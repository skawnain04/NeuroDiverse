PTSD,Other,a Finance Analyst 1,4 months,"Job requirements be like?
First you might try and correct your English, that may be a deterrent to your progress in customer service;
In that role speaking writing and reading- working that and then progress to jobs not requiring a Master's degree because at that level your writing is precisely correctly written - try a JC that is my suggestion
Steps: AA-BA-Masters maybe about 6 yrs at 21 you're still able to achieve it with dedication and perseverance.

PTSD,Other,a BBQ Cleaning Service Owner 1,4 months,"I would laugh, but to be honest you speak the truth.

I ordered a pizza last Sunday.

After he left I closed the door and started eating it. I noticed through my front window the delivery driver was still there.

I went out and asked him if everything is ok.

He told me he has a flat tire and is waiting for CAA to come fix it.

Him and I started talking and in our conversation I found out that he is a licensed plumber before he obtained this pizza delivery job.

During COVID he was laid off. He's never been able to get back into the field.

I'm a Gas Fitter TSSA licensed with over 12 years experience and I'm also having problems getting back into the trades. (My company shut down).

I remember the days when we put our resume out on a Friday and by Monday lunch we had 5+ job interviews lined up...

PTSD,Other,a BBQ Cleaning Service Owner 1,4 months,"He was a plumber. I am a HVAC gas fitter. We both agree that it's very hard to find work right now in the trades.

There are too many people and not enough jobs. Everything is expensive, so people aren't calling up people a much to replace / repair things.

I went into a costumers house a few days before i was unemployed and did a FREE diagnostic on his furnace and air-conditioner.

After I told him the problem he told me he will have his cousin or son fix it. He just wanted a free diagnostic as that's what most of us offer.

It's common now, especially with so many new comers coming from India / Philippines where they are all educated in repairing random things (or someone in the family can ... )

My wife is a Filipina. If I died tomorrow and the furnace / toilet / fireplace / boiler / sink broke she just makes a post in Facebook and 100 Filipinos will be messaging her will next to nothing prices.

That's the same with my my good Indian friend. His wife is the godmother of my son.

PTSD,Other,Florida Middle School 1,a year,I have felt that while teaching abroad. My opinions never mattered. Where I was they needed English teachers and expected me to teach 5 year olds when I had no teaching experience. No training was involved. Management was focused on financial gain and having absolute control of everyone especially foreign teachers. I stuck it out and ended up staying 12 years on multiple 1 year contracts. I learned as I stayed how to get around the BS. By the end I resolved to never teach again and took a job at a big box store in the US for 1 1/2 years. Was on a sub list as well. A school called with a long term sub position. Turned into a full-time permanent position. Staff is great. Been here 7 years. Maybe a change of scenery will help.

The unions have a knack for fighting for things to improve schools and educating the community on issues, which is why 99% of the time the community sides with teachers! If there are no unions, then you get what happens in the red states, which usually have worse systems for educating the youth as evidenced by the Deep South and their track records. Conservative teachers, keep voting against your own self interest, because, you know, somebody may want a different pronoun!.

The union here is nothing but the teachers who don't actually want to do their job but still want to get paid. They need the safety net of a union lawyer. The union hasn't fought for actual improvement here in years. Most teachers here don't join the union, because they don't listen to us.

PTSD,Other,,a year,I wish I could either love teaching or find a calling elsewhere. Neither seems possible right now. It‚Äôs certainly not tenable but I will not leave my family high and dry. They must be provided for.,7,9/20/24 12:40,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/i-quit-my-teaching-job-i-couldnt-take-it-anymore-i-did-everything-in-my-power-to-make-this-work-even-joined-a-teachers-union,1,3,106
PTSD,Other,,a year,"Not all teaching positions and not all school districts are created equal unfortunately. Most people in my district absolutely love working here. It's a great environment and we get great support. The neighboring town's school district, who I end up working with a lot because of my position, is the poster child of toxic work environments as far a school job s are concerned. They can't hire or keep quality staff, they have hostil administrators and the school board is a bunch of shady yes men. The culture of the students is negative and violent and parents don't want their kids going there. There have even been problems with misappropriation of funds, and not just a few bucks.
The point to consider is that work environment can make all the difference in some cases. You may not want to give up on teaching yet. There are very rewarding and enjoyable teaching jobs out there. After some rest you may come back to it in a better school and find that it's what you hoped it would be.
If it turns out that teaching just isn't for you then there are plenty of other important and satisfying professions. I left a different profession for teaching. There's something for everyone.",8,9/20/24 12:40,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/i-quit-my-teaching-job-i-couldnt-take-it-anymore-i-did-everything-in-my-power-to-make-this-work-even-joined-a-teachers-union,1,3,107

I should have raised it sooner and should not have let it go so far, that was 100% my fault. I was trying not to ruffle feathers and got mistreated.

They don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôm experiencing PTSD now. They ousted me from the job even though I was killing it. I never showed them any emotions because I felt the environment was so toxic and there was no trust or support for me. My mom was sick and I left early (6pm) to see her in the hospital and dumped most of the responsibilities on my sisters. My friend died a week later and they didn‚Äôt even know because I never told them. I didn‚Äôt feel like I could tell them. My management team always wanted me to trust them and have an open relationship with them but they also stabbed me in the back with information I told them so I stopped. They coddled the analysts though like crazy","3

PTSD,Other,an Associate Consultant 2,4 months,I was treated badly at my organisation for just working remotely. I was doing everything I was told and asked to do.. I was working remotely as there wasn't any need as such. I was denied promotion 2 times just because I used to finish my work properly and they didn't had any other grounds apart from me working remotely. After talking to them I realised that they just don't care about me. I took another job offer although I was too navie and unaware that I am underselling myself..

I moved from indiana to Seattle and I can tell you the cost of living difference was huge. 3 months after i got here my employer closed down this location and their other location was almost 2 hours away. Luckily i found another job fairly quickly...about 30 days. My anxiety during this time was through the roof. Would I do it again......ABSOLUTELY!

And obviously if you lose the job, you‚Äôd quickly burn through any savings, unless you find something else quick or move back home. Big cities are also unsafe and unkept nowadays, so to have a good or comparable standard of living you‚Äôd have to live in the nice suburban wealthy areas of any big metro, which again are disproportionately expensive to the otherwise abysmal standards of inner cities. If it‚Äôs just for a quick experience, it may work out just for fun, but big cities are definitely not for the long term unless you live in their wealthy areas.

PTSD,Other,a Logistics 1,7 months,"I agree that you certainly didn‚Äôt deserve the treatment you encountered and you‚Äôre right by seeing it as an example of what not to do as a manager when you‚Äôre in that position. When it came to the point of termination I would listen carefully to how my manager would say the word as it told me exactly what their intent was. Many in the workplace act as moles and jump at the chance to share what they hear you say, see you do, maybe embellish just a little bit. That can‚Äôt hurt, it‚Äôs only a tiny bit of embellishment, right? Doesn‚Äôt surprised me today that while some believe such actions will lead them higher and farther, truth is they deceive themselves in the end. It‚Äôs most important to maintain your own integrity. We‚Äôre talking about the health of your mind and body when you get to turn off the light at bedtime and being able to go to sleep with a clear and unburdened mind of guilt because you choose to take the high road and not engage in the petty behavior you may have seen on display. It‚Äôs hard not to throw mud, but in the end it‚Äôs you asking yourself if it‚Äôs work you want to do and it doesn‚Äôt matter as much for whom other than for you.

PTSD,Other,Prince georges community college 1,7 months,"I am sorry. Toxic workplaces abound. I suffer workplace bullying. I am under the care of a therapist and am working diligently to find another job. Through support and help, I was able to stop the worst of the bullying. 1. I document EVERY encounter, and filed a well documented complaint. 2. I got the courage one day to simply tell my supervisor to stop because I wouldn't be taking the bullying behavior anymore. Those both got me face-to-face with the VP. I should mention I work in a division that should know better: HR and Professional Development. The VP is not on my side, but the interjection was good enough to keep me safe and sane while I seek other employment since my supervisor knows I will not hesitate to file a complaint and do document. My advice is to get good help to help you heal. My workplace bullying includes gaslighting, yelling, belittling, mobbing (getting others in the unit to gang up on me), my excellent work being told was unacceptable without reason or for.petry reaons, removal of my job duties and undermining/hampering my professional trajectory, denigrating my work and ideas but my supervisor then using my work and ideas. These are people who should know this behavior is unacceptable, but perhaps that makes them more dangerous. These types of people will never acknowledge their behavior is wrong, they will never apologize, they will tell you you are imagining things or tell you 'that's just how it is around here'. All that is BS. Don't take it. Work with good help to make certain you do not absorb it. Take care of you. Work hard to be the best you.

The outburst wasn't about you. So don't take it personally or internalize it. You do now have a wall up that is valid and it will only take you to trust again and let it down. Allow him to be human as well as he will allow you to express your own upsets as they come about. Do you cry or throw things when you get upset? Well, he yells sometimes. That's okay. We are all different. And part of marriage is ""for better or not so perfect"". Forgive and pray for your heart to be open to imperfection I'm the person you chose to Wed. That person is still there.

I do something super simple/mindless like run the budget for that project and update the budget to actual. I flag emails and reread any flagged emails for immediate needs. Then when my brain feels revved up from that, I switch to the more difficult task.

I break it up into parts and set a timer. Do it for ten minutes. If after ten minutes you hate it and it‚Äôs just been a struggle, walk away. Take a five min break and stretch and switch to a different project. You can try that one again later.

You should seek out and be open minded about direct and honest feedback. As a hiring manager, who has conducted several interviews, I'm not just looking at the skill set for the job but what else and individual may have to offer. Even more importantly is the individual coming across authentic? Does the individual seem accountable and coachable? There is more behind those bland questions then you may realize. If there is a specific job that you want, engage both your current manager and hiring manager prior to applying.

They rescinded, based on what you said in your earlier post, coz you dithered. You weren‚Äôt committed to the job YOU‚ÄôD applied for. What else did you expect?

This time, don‚Äôt screw around. You‚Äôre either going to make the jump or you‚Äôre not. If you‚Äôre not, because it‚Äôs too risky to your stability, then have some decency and let them know so that they can find someone that will be enthusiastic about the job.

I can only imagine what that poor hiring manager is going to think of you if you did that - honestly, if I were in their shoes, I‚Äôd not even reinstate the offer.

That said, while they have no obligation to retain the offer, but, if they‚Äôve reinstated it, they will likely honor it.

Pros are pretty numerous and I think it‚Äôs well worth it to take the break.

Cons are that you might not get to roll back on to that project when you come back, unless it‚Äôs pretty long term. You can talk with the partner about that possibility.

No one needs to know (and it‚Äôs none of their business) why you need the break. Talk with your doctor about what you‚Äôd like to do and if they‚Äôd be willing to write you an excuse for it.

Talk to your partner about needing time off for health reasons and keep it at that. Then reach out to HR and ask what the process is for take a leave of absence.

Would yell at me and belittle me then turn around and apologize and call me one of his closest friends. Constantly teased me about things like breastfeeding my son when he was two. That came up because he kept harassing me about taking the covid shot (even though I was an independent contractor) so I told him I wasn't because I was breastfeeding. I quit March 2023 because I was so burnt out from running his company and helping him build another. I feel like I'm just now finally starting to recover. It's not worth it to stay in that situation.

PTSD,Other,a Vice President 1,4 months,"Penalties for a psychologist making a diagnosis after only one hour without sufficient information can vary depending on the jurisdiction, the specific circumstances, and whether the behavior is reported and investigated. Potential penalties can include:

1. **Professional Sanctions**: The psychologist may face disciplinary action from their state licensing board, which could include suspension or revocation of their license, fines, mandatory supervision, or required additional training.

2. **Ethics Violations**: The APA can impose sanctions on its members for violating ethical guidelines, which could range from a reprimand to expulsion from the association.

3. **Legal Consequences**: If the premature diagnosis leads to harm, the psychologist could face civil lawsuits for malpractice. This could result in financial compensation to the patient and potentially damage the psychologist's professional reputation.

4. **Employment Consequences**: The psychologist's employer might take action, which could include termination of employment.

These actions are based on the ethical standards outlined in the APA's Ethics Code, particularly under sections concerning competence and the necessity of sufficient information before making professional judgments.

For more specific information, you might refer to the [APA Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct](https://www.apa.org/ethics/code) and contact your local state licensing board.",,9/20/24 13:08,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/ive-worked-with-two-therapists-and-a-psychiatrist-the-therapists-i-worked-with-for-3-months-and-4-months-the-psych-i-saw-for,6,39,806

PTSD,Other,a Vice President 1,4 months,I'm married to a psychologist. That is 100% accurate. It's bonkers that you think a licensed therapist can have a diagnosis of bipolar disorder in 1 hour. You are beyond delusional. You will find ZERO articles or professional links to support your claim. I've already linked to the relevant APA section.,,9/20/24 13:08,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/ive-worked-with-two-therapists-and-a-psychiatrist-the-therapists-i-worked-with-for-3-months-and-4-months-the-psych-i-saw-for,9,39,809
PTSD,Other,a Vice President 1,4 months,"Diagnosing bipolar disorder involves a comprehensive assessment by a licensed mental health professional, often following specific guidelines and using established diagnostic tools. Here are the steps typically involved:

1. **Clinical Interview**: The clinician conducts a thorough interview to gather information about the patient's history, symptoms, and overall functioning. This includes exploring mood changes, energy levels, behavior, sleep patterns, and any psychotic symptoms.

2. **Medical History**: The clinician reviews the patient's medical history to rule out any physical conditions that could be causing the symptoms. This may include a physical examination and lab tests.

3. **Family History**: Since bipolar disorder can have a genetic component, understanding the family history of mental health issues can be crucial.

4. **Standardized Diagnostic Tools**: The clinician may use standardized questionnaires and rating scales such as:
- **Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ)**: A screening tool that helps identify the presence of bipolar disorder symptoms.
- **Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)**: Measures the severity of manic episodes.
- **Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS)**: Assesses the severity of depressive symptoms.

5. **DSM-5 Criteria**: The diagnosis is confirmed using the criteria outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). For bipolar disorder, this includes:
- **Bipolar I Disorder**: Characterized by one or more manic episodes, possibly accompanied by major depressive episodes.
- **Bipolar II Disorder**: Characterized by one or more major depressive episodes and at least one hypomanic episode.
- **Cyclothymic Disorder**: Chronic fluctuating mood disturbance involving numerous periods of hypomanic symptoms and depressive symptoms that do not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode.

6. **Differential Diagnosis**: The clinician rules out other potential causes for the symptoms, such as other psychiatric disorders (e.g., major depressive disorder, schizophrenia), substance abuse, or medical conditions.

PTSD,Other,a Senior Counsel 1,3 months,"Masking more commonly comes from the world of ADHD/Autism, which is obviously not the same as PTSD but (loosely) shares some root issues: imbalances in neurotransmitters.

The thrust of masking is it‚Äôs a coping mechanism wherein the sufferer tries to hide and disguise parts of themselves so as to blend in- ‚Äúacting normal.‚Äù Because they don‚Äôt know what is normal, they suppress their natural reactions and try to mimic what others do/say (including body language, tone, facial expressions). It‚Äôs exhausting, shaming, and isolating. BUT!!! It brings us to a useful point.

‚ÄúI‚Äù am comprised of a combination of thoughts, feelings, emotions, experiences, memories. Who ‚ÄúI‚Äù am would affect how I do things, including how I do my job. I technically have free will, but really it‚Äôs a limited spectrum of possible actions, dictated by my personality and not prone to change absent extenuating circumstances. I‚Äôm never going to steal a loaf of bread in my day to day life. It would take something drastic, like extreme poverty and a sister‚Äôs starving child to make me do so. Making changes to who I am is possible but quite difficult and requires copious amounts of effort and therapy. It‚Äôs also a long process and we want results now.

I‚Äôm a bit neurotic, shy, introverted, afraid of saying the wrong thing. But what if I were to create a new character from scratch? Not limited to my personality quirks, I can make him confident (without being arrogant), caring (without being a doormat), outgoing and goofy who DNGAF if anyone thinks his singing and dancing are lame at the happy hour karaoke. And when I wake up in the morning and grab my briefcase I pretend I‚Äôm an actor playing this role I created. And when I come home and/or log off, I stop playing them. You have to wear multiple hats as a lawyer anyways, what‚Äôs one more?

My lawyer character is awesome. Best of all, shit that happens at work only happens to my character, not me. So when my character screws up a filing and gets chewed out? Sucks to be him, that‚Äôs his problem to fix. The stress doesn‚Äôt bleed into my personal life.

Now I acknowledge this may sound crazy. But I‚Äôve got a broken brain, I‚Äôve got to Maguyver some solutions to be functional. Changing who I actually am to get better work results was impossible. But reframing it and pretending to be an actor, shit I‚Äôve been crushing it for years now.","6

While there, I was made a director level and showered with praise for a year, then out of nowhere they hired a vp over me, who hired a senior director. Both expected me to continue doing the full scale of the work as I had been, but wouldnt allow me to take ownership. They would come in behind me after countless hours on a project, change one small thing, and take credit for the project. To the extent of even showing up to group meetings and presenting my work as their own even though most people in the room had seen me on site directing an event (for example). They also engaged in a lot of corporate negging with me to get there way.

PTSD,Other,,5 months,"Telling someone who is chronically ill and depressed to change their diet and think positive is so demeaning and the actual antithesis of being helpful. If it were that easy, none of us would be suffering. Trust me, I know from experience.
First of all- get into a good support group with people who actually understand and can provide empathy and constructive guidance. To be honest, however, sometimes there just isn't much guidance in terms of navigating the workforce or everyday life with these issues. Unfortunately, even in 2024 our society has yet to tackle these issues, and that is one reason behind the high uptick of poverty, houselessness, and worsening MH issues. It's a spiral and so many get caught in it because, after all- you don't *look* sick, so you just need a healthier diet and to make your bed in the morning.
I understand most are genuinely ignorant and are just trying to help. But when someone experiences the sane answers for decades, without any *real* help and improvement, well, they can get a tad cynical. It's scary to lose hope for how you can survive the rest of your life without being able to depend on these basics that many people don't realize aren't in our tool house. But what I will say is that there is *always* hope, you just need to look in the right places. Look outside the box, and create a life that works for you and can eventually help you be productive again. Once you can get to that step, you will feel swells of motivation coming back. It isn't easy, some days will feel like defeat, but you can do it, little by little. Listen to your body, and reach out to anything and anyone that inspires you. Find like minded people on social media platforms that can guide you with their own stories. And for goodness sake- don't settle for any job or health practitioner that doesn't listen to, respect, or advocate for you and your VALID needs. ü´Ç",6,9/20/24 13:11,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/due-to-health-issues-i-have-lost-a-bunch-of-jobs-i-have-ulcerative-colitis-depression-anxiety-ptsd-and-insomnia-my-physical,1,44,890

If that is all you have the strength for, then at least you will have the dishes done and not piling up for 4 days and then looking like an impossible task. The other housework chores can be split up and done one or two chores each day. Call the social service agencies in your city and find out if any organization offers volunteer help for housework. In my city there is free help with housecleaning, yard maintenance, dog walking, and other things that seniors or chronically ill people have trouble doing themselves.

PTSD,Other,a Customer Service Representative 1,3 months,"As a person with ptsd, this is a very difficult conversation. Ptsd patients like myself have a very hard time communicating and when we do, unfortunately for some, not all. it will become explosive rage. First thing, if and only if you are willing to continue for a love one. Is reassurance, reasure that they are safe, They are loved, and that everything is OK. Dont make them feel like a Burden by saying hey, I can't help you anymore. You need professional help. Unfortunately wen we are hurting it seems like we are being dismissed, or pushed off to another because we are that ""bad"". Abandonment, trust, loyalty, are always an issue. And most are not related to nor due to you at all. Just unfortunate experiences they had to suffer through that come back. No matter how hard you try to avoid thoughts negative thoughts, therapy, medicine does help but does NOT make it go away. And yes ptsd can be for life. 10 years with my partner and still going strong. If you truly love them, give them the best you can with constant love,reassurance, trust, and understanding. If you are being affected by this in a very negative way to your own mental health please be careful with announcing this to your partner because they will feel guilty very guilty. But make it clear that they need to work with you too, that a relationship is a two way street. And make it very clear that you aren't pushing them away. That you are not taking away from their own personal pain whatsoever. But expressing that you too are struggling to constantly see your partner (with ptsd) in pain and it's taking a big toll on you. And if they don't unfortunately it's best to give them ""space"" to clear their minds and seek help. They must try to understand you are human too, that you can develop residual effective as well. I'm sorry. I hope this makes sense and helps. best to you and your partner.
