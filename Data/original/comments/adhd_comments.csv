ADHD,Other,a Director 3,4 months,"Manager 1, strong work demonstrating how medication is not tested on women. You are fighting the good fight in educating people in a non-confrontational way.

Women often may have incredibly different side effects. But it is not studied, measured and properly factored into medication options. The reason for exclusion is often veiled as fear for impacting a woman’s pregnancy. But there are plenty of women who do not want kids / more kids and would agree to be tested. Also there is a lack of funding. Erection has been studied many many times more than menopause. Funding needs to go to women’s health.

Laws are also targeted at women. Women can’t have birth control, access to safe abortion (simply means was pregnant for a second through 20 weeks and didn’t end in a live birth). Women (and men dealing with partners going through this) can’t even talk about having an abortion in the open — which most sexually active women have simply by having a late period but many more have had horrific things go wrong to a pregnancy they want — because abortion is being criminalized. Treating women is being criminalized too. Forcing pregnancy on someone is equivalent to taking them for 9 months and growing second organs to harvest for others. Men cannot even be forced to give blood or donate organs upon death. Waiting for sepsis to start aborting is not what is right for women. In some countries only women can treat women but women can’t be educated. We are on that path now in the US.

Even if you are not literally affected by medication, many women may be mentally affected by the attack on women’s health, and they lack the absence of medicine that could’ve helped them through many medical occurrences (tough monthly period, menopause).",8,2024-09-17 20:53:46,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/really-annoyed-by-the-sexism-in-healthcare-they-do-not-test-medications-on-women-so-we-dont-know-what-side-effects-theyll,1,1,18

How they say it doesn’t cause weight gain when I have friends that all blew up (every girl in college did) once they started taking bc.

As a default workplaces don't seem to adequately take into account the differences between male and female employees. While of course an individual like OP could perhaps go through the ADA accommodation process to work from home during her cycle, does that process perhaps constitute an undue burden? This is a sensitive topic which she is clearly uncomfortable about would it perhaps make more sense to default allow women to take the accommodations they need at this time instead of going through an ADA process? Perhaps they could put in a generic health code for working from home to avoid this discomfort and embarrassment?","8

ADHD,Other,a Consultant 1,4 months,"On the first point about meds I entirely agree with the bias problem in that regard.

But you completely lost me with your second point there… I’m a F too (late 20s) in an even more male dominated field than consulting (title is not current) and half the age of all my male colleagues, and I still agree with SM1, it is not sexism that YOU feel uncomfortable sharing that you’re not feeling well and need to be home. I would have no problem telling my 70 yo male boss that I am not feeling well and expect that he would respect that and I wouldn’t face any repercussions for it based on my existing reputation at work.

Nobody is actively discriminating against you here for being a woman… just because you feel uncomfortable expressing that you have a health issue (that no one is asking you to clarify) doesn’t equate to discrimination. It sucks to have to deal with this as a woman but you’re entirely off the mark by trying to pass the fact that you can’t assert yourself as ‘sexism’. Also it is rather cringe throwing around accusations like ‘pick me girl’ as a retort but since you shared your age that makes a lot more sense now lol. And I used to be more like you when I was a few years younger and more self conscious, but these are things you will hopefully learn later on with more experience.

This is ultimately an insecurity issue (which I can empathize with having been there myself) but is really not an actual sexism/discrimination issue …","9

Everyone who disagrees with you is an “incel”, apparently, also. Immediately reverting to personal insults shows off a lot.

ADHD,Other,a Manager 1,4 months,"SM1
1) while I agree that OP perhaps was not as detached and neutral in their comments as may have been ideal; I think given that they are clearly in pain and distressed that is understandable.

2) I disagree with you and C1 that this is not a sexism issue in the workplace. This is a private female related health issue that will come up every month and by OPs description will require a accommodations for some amount of days every month, which would put her in a situation of needing an ADA accommodation and not merely being able at the time to say I have a medical issue as the pattern will become noticeable. This is an example of Structural sexism rather than sexism at an individual level, you perhaps have been privileged enough by race and class to not have had to contend with structural racism or sexism and therefore this concept is foreign to you.

3) I agree with OP that you and C1 have given coverage to men who clearly have sexist views toward women. She is correct in that they have used you and C1 as coverage for their sexist beliefs (I had one of them argue that he was now anti-equal rights for women because I called out the sexism present in healthcare). While I agree some of her arguments were presented in an unpolished manner, instead of calmly addressing her you chose to attack her and side with men who declare that women should not have equal rights. I think you both would do well to take a breath and consider how you will feel when you are in a situation where your pain is dismissed and minimized and how you would like to have men declaring women should be silent about bias in healthcare and that you are hysterical and your pain is not real as the only voices around you.","7

OP did have some good points initially prior to her follow up comment, but her own subsequent childish attitude is the thing bringing herself down.

ADHD,Other,a Manager 1,4 months,"C1 I have re-read the initial comments from SM1 and you. I think you both adopted a rather harsh tone. I am a POC and I personally know several other POC who you remind me of who like to deny that structural racism exists merely because we were lucky enough to make it. I worked very hard to get to where I am, but I also recognized the luck involved and know that many people just as smart and hardworking as me could not make it. I still contend with structural racism in my life despite rarely experiencing racism on an individual level.

You and SM1 both criticized OP for being too insecure to bring up her health issues with her employer and then when she mentioned the intimacy of it told her she could be vague. That is untrue this is a chronic problem and will require long term accommodations she will need to disclose eventually to receive the accommodations that she needs. I can empathize with her and how anxiety inducing that would be. She may worry about her pain being dismissed as female pain frequently is.

You said you did not read the other threads, then perhaps you should not have commented? I can understand that between her physical discomfort and being under sexist attacks from several people she would react harshly. However, I do not understand why you would react so harshly and with so little empathy unless like my POC friends you are angry by the perceived weakness of others as you think every should be as strong as you and able to fight and make it like you did. It is okay for people to be shy and insecure and anxious. You do not forfeit your human rights because you are meek.","4

ADHD,Other,a Consultant 1,4 months,"M1 Our tone was direct and to the point, ‘harsh’ is entirely subjective and unfortunately I do not believe in coddling and sugarcoating. Our comments were not rude or contained personal attacks like OPs. You’re also entirely projecting something completely unrelated at hand here bringing race into the equation. Literally nobody has commented on that whatsoever let alone ‘denied structural racism exists’. You should maybe consider why you’re intent on bringing this in because it looks very much like projection. I think we should be able to isolate and discuss one issue without needing to bring in something irrelevant into the mix.

I have nothing against anyone who is shy or insecure or anxious, I have dealt with all of those conditions personally and still do and can empathize. What I cannot empathize with, is using this as an excuse to project onto other people, and what I DO take issue with is displays of immaturity and lack of self awareness. These are pretty crucial for navigating the world as an adult.

OP please stop projecting and throwing words around. Nobody is ‘rejoicing’ in your pain or jealous of you. We have also not by any means invalidated your actual experiences. It is wonderful that you are the first in your family to accomplish these things. The fact that you may be white or well off was never any point of consideration anyway until M1 tried to bring race/class into the conversation lol.

This is how these biases form, till they get to the major decisions like clinical studies.
We shouldn’t make OP apologize for her delivery of a bodily function because that’s the problem of women’s health in general - women not being able to articulate what they feel to receive appropriate medical care or in OP’s point, to go home from work when she’s excessively bleeding due to fear of judgement from her team.

ADHD,Other,a Senior Director 2,4 months,"OP, first I’d like to say I’m so sorry you went through that. In the future, I’d encourage you to leave citing a “medical issue that just came up which you need to take care of”. You don’t need to give them specifics, no matter what day of the year or what e-mails went around for something spontaneous like that. I’d give the same advice if you were having a rash, spiked a fever, etc.

Your feelings are valid re: feeling like this could be held against you for promotion. It can, and even though it’s borderline illegal, it doesn’t stop them from doing it for reasons such as “utilization was lower than expected” or “lack of urgency during sprint periods”. It stinks and that does not make it any better, but also shouldn’t hinder you from taking care of yourself and your health.

Those sorts of thought patterns usually come from one of three things 1) lack of self-advocacy skills in your toolbox, 2) toxic work environments, or 3) a history of abuse in your past. Just because other people haven’t sat in your exact shoes, doesn’t mean you processed the information incorrectly, just that you processed it the best you could with the information available at the time. The good news is, you can either advocate for yourself better (request an accommodation, beg out of stuff when needed in a way that feels safer), find a less toxic environment, or do work to move forward from trauma that drives those thoughts. Either way, you’ll be better off next time. Happy to chat with you via DM as another woman with a chronic medical issue if you’d ever like to discuss potential paths forward or the ADA accommodation process.

My heart goes out to you, that must have been a very stressful day.","6

That means drug testing would've occurred 2000-2005. Even today there is still a wide disparity in male and female drug test recipients and the NIH only required females be included in medical studies as of 2016. In 2000-2005 it would've been common, the norm that a drug had no or few female test subjects.","18

ADHD,Other,a Manager 1,4 months,"M2 until 1993 the FDA made it illegal to use female test subjects, it was not a matter of opting out by females they were banned. Additionally, drug companies intentionally target only male test subjects because they lead to data with less adverse medical reactions. Finally, even the cells and animals used in early stage testing are predominantly male cells and male animals.

There have been numerous instances where when research was sex segregated they found that 1st stage research showed incredible results on the female cells being tested upon but because they did not have great results on the male cells the project was entirely abandoned. Whereas when a drug shows promise on only male cells it is still allowed to proceed. It was only in 2016 that there became a requirement to test female cells and female animals too.","12

ADHD,Other,a Manager 1,4 months,"CO1 you joke but they actually have historically tested female medicine on only male test subjects. Including a study of the effect of obesity on uterine and breast cancer that only looked at male subjects. Males do not have uteruses.

They also have tested female birth control on male subjects to skew the results to make it appear like the drug has fewer negative health side effects. Males are less likely to experience severe side effects from female birth control medications, so by using them as a great subject pharmaceutical companies can report their drug is safer and has fewer side effects.","5

Your reward for medicine being tested in male subjects (male cells, male animals, and male humans) is that by the time a drug gets to you, you can be reasonably assured of its safety and don't have to contend with horrific side effects for years that are dismissed by your physician. Your reward is that new medications that show no positive effect on women but a positive effect on men are proceeded with and released to market. Your reward is that drugs work better on you and are safer for you. Your reward is that conditions that only effect men are adequately studied and a treatment developed.","8

ADHD,Other,a Manager 1,4 months,"KPMG1 I can see that you are a 🧌 and also grossly uneducated on this topic. The literal rats and other animals used for testing are male not female. The literal single cells used for testing are male cells not female cells. If on rare occasion female cells are tested, if a medication shows promise on the female cells but not on the male cells the research is abandoned. However, if medicine shows promise on male cells but not female cells it is proceeded with. The only medical research being conducted is research that helps males whether or not it works for females.

The entire female population are lab rats as side effects from drugs are not detected in testing for them as the drugs are not tested on females. 8/10 drugs pulled from market for extreme adverse side effects are pulled after those side effects are discovered in females, because females react differently to drugs. Ambien is a perfect example it reacts vastly differently in women than men and is metabolized vastly differently so dosage needs to be vastly different. But females were not test subjects so it was only after it went to mass market that horrific and potentially deadly side effects were discovered in females taking it.","4

ADHD,Other,an Information Security Architect 1,4 months,"Yeah the anxiety and depression deal, despite being diagnosed with those at 19, is part of why it took another decade to understand ADHD was in the mix. Esp with overlap of symptoms.
Then the symptom of the three would interact and all be harder to manage. Just a cycle of
anxiety about getting things done and depression’s apathy stripping me of a desire to do anything overwhelming me to the point of the ol’ adhd shutdow. Which then would make me anxious and deepen the depression. The circle of life continues.


The big thing, I think, is the general public understanding of ADHD (depression too though not to this same degree) is really bad. There’s plenty of folks whose symptoms definitely do include attention/focus issues and hyperactivity but other symptoms can include task paralysis, working memory, and planning issues. These end up making things as a working adult (and parent in my case) challenging.

ADHD,Other,a Manager 3,4 months,"Yep. The pill was only tested on men. Very sexist.


Jokes aside, yeah the clinical trial practice prior to the 90s was pretty bad. Not just a long gender lines but also minorities. It's gotten better but still room for improvement (something like 40% representation in studies for major diseases vs 50% of disease population)

I don't think sexism is truly the driver though (which doesn't make it less annoying). It comes down to money and expense. If you're trying to test for an effect, it's going to be harder the more variation you introduce. So you'll need to make your trials bigger to compensate.",6,2024-09-17 20:53:52,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/really-annoyed-by-the-sexism-in-healthcare-they-do-not-test-medications-on-women-so-we-dont-know-what-side-effects-theyll,1,1,137

(And if you're trying to argue there not significant biological hormonal and non hormonal differences between men and women - I can't help you). But agree.. you're getting findings skewed toward a narrower set of the population. Those results are valid for the variation you've controlled for but won't necessarily generalize past that.

To correct for that you need larger trials.

And more recently for major disease studies it's not like the split is 0%. it's closer to 40% (at least according to the AAMC article I read)

Point is its gotten better, but there's still a gap to close.

Introducing female rats would require drastically increasing the N = , along with controlling for their menstrual cycle.

Other times, this would mean doing 10pm to 6am MRI scans because the scanner is booked up that day, and the scan can't wait to align with their menstrual cycle.

ADHD,Other,a Research Associate 1,4 months,"I work in clinical trials and even between today and 9 years ago when I started the field is almost unrecognizable now. There has been a huge effort to increase diversity in clinical trials. The FDA will often tell companies now to go back and revise their investigational plans to include analyses for gender, ethnic groups, and children. It doesn't correct the past but at least future generations will have it better. Newer drugs that are being approved right now will have had more thoughtful clinical trial development than drugs that have been around since the 90s and earlier. I'm sorry you are in this situation - I'm a woman and in an ethnic group that was typically not included in the development of most drugs prior to the current times but I did not take prescriptions as a child and as an adult, I was fully informed and aware by then. I feel for you that you are finding out now after the fact and have to process it like this.",4,2024-09-17 20:53:55,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/really-annoyed-by-the-sexism-in-healthcare-they-do-not-test-medications-on-women-so-we-dont-know-what-side-effects-theyll,1,1,176

I think the takeaway is that it’s just going to take a long time for the research (broadly) to catch up.

ADHD,Other,a Solutions Engineer 2,a year,"A coaching plan is a pre-PIP in many organizations. Even in at will states you can't get fired without cause due to the legal repercussions an organization can face. In this case a coaching plan is put in place to document your work.

You goal is to either seek employment elsewhere or complete it.

In many instances if you don't complete the coaching plan you will be put on a PIP which is more legally binding. You're ultimately agreeing at that point your performance is an issue and agree to the terms.

I don't really know anyone who's gotten out of a PIP. The silver lining is though is that they may offer you the option to resign before being put on a PIP and then you can negotiate severance etc.

Don’t let anyone label ya as ADHD, but you can’t hide behind it either & be successful. It’s real so face it head on with a lot of prayer & friends/family by your side & I bet you’ll plow thru it.
You are gifted & talented at something & probably in a way few others are. If you don’t know what that is, ask your good friends/family to tell you what they turn to you for! If that isn’t what you are even remotely doing at AMEX, start looking. You may just be in the wrong job!","6

1. Do you care about your job to try to follow the plan.
2 Are you capable of following the plan, instructions and expectations that have been reviewed and discussed with you.
If the answer is yes to both then you should be fine.
My mom was a VP at the Plantation Fl, office. They absolutely do not set out to fire people. (Exception is shitty boss) but they are graded on their turnover rate as well because both firing and hiring and training all come at a high expense to the company.
Ideally they would like to train you once, you do your job for 30 years and retire. That’s the most cost affective outcome for Amex and management hates training new people. It’s more work for them.
Follow the plan and they will have zero reason to fire you don’t and they will. It’s that simple.
HR will smile, be understanding and say the right things about ADHD I have it too. They will not continue to pay anybody who can’t do the job when that employee can’t perform the job regardless of conditions.

ADHD,Other,a Head of Product 1,a year,"This is my soap box as an individual who has been diagnosed with Asperger’s and has struggled with managing it my entire life.

It has recently become very trendy to call oneself autistic or ADHD because you “display some
Symptoms”. For those who claim they’re undiagnosed autists - you are not a doctor. You do not have the ability to diagnose yourself as autistic. Mental health diagnoses are very real and very impactful for people who receive them. By claiming to be something you have not been diagnosed with, you are diluting the severity of the actual individuals who have these conditions. Many individuals who claim they are “undiagnosed autistic” are nowhere near being on the spectrum… but their claims put a very real onus on individuals such as myself who truly struggle to assimilate by giving uneducated individuals (the majority of the world TBH) an unrealistic expectation of what can be accomplished by “masking”.

Autism is not a trend, it’s not something to take lightly, and it’s not something to claim if you don’t have it. If you truly believe you are autistic, please do the work and speak to a professional… there is a very high likelihood you’ll find that you are not, in fact, autistic.",12,2024-09-17 20:55:47,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/im-curious-to-know-how-many-people-working-in-advertising-are-neurodivergent-especially-in-creative-departments-is,1,3,243
ADHD,Author,Authoran Associate Creative Director,a year,"I’m sorry you feel that way, but this is a hard disagree on my part. Autism or ADHD don’t automatically become real the moment you get an official diagnosis from a psychiatrist or psychologist. Neurodivergence is what some of us are with or without a diagnosis.
Sure, there’s a lot more prevalence in how many people identify as autistic/ADHD than before, but so much of this is just because there’s a lot more information out there. Women and POC have been historically gone largely undiagnosed until somewhat recently. There are a ton of unhelpful, outdated and wrong stereotypes about what neurodivergence is. Self diagnosis is actually something quite accepted in the community and depending on how far you want/need to take it, there are steps to make it also clinically valid. Not all of us have the means to or want to get an official diagnosis. My son needed an official diagnosis to get access to resources for school. Our insurance doesn’t cover this and we have to pay about $4k out of pocket to get it. I’ve scored definitely within autistic range in RAADS and AQ which is what’s used for referrals to getting diagnosed. However, I’m 50 and just coming to terms with the fact that despite my own denial about it, I show markers for autism. But what the fuck am I going to do with an official diagnosis? This official diagnosis would only be stigmatizing if I disclosed it at work. It would not help me get any accommodations from employers, would largely be ignored by my own family and I‘d just be gaslighted for “using it as an excuse”. I would have ZERO use for it and I don’t have 5K to spend just so you can be convinced.
As you very well know, this is a spectrum. Not even a gradient. Some of us are Elon Musk or Anthony Hopkins and some of us are non-verbal people who can’t live independently and some of us are anywhere in between or not even on the same lane. Some are very good at masking and for some it’s extremely hard. And if the way you experience your “Asperger’s” (that term is clinically out of use since 2013 BTW) doesn’t line up with someone else’s experience, it’s because we ALL experience this a different way. Masking if a VERY real thing and while you shit on it because you think people are making it up, some people have gotten good at some aspects of it JUST to be able to survive in a world that is not made for us. If someone never was diagnosed as a child, how ELSE do you expect them to survive if not by trying to fool everyone?
I understand that if you were diagnosed as a child, your experience may be very different. But think about how life would’ve been for you, had you never been diagnosed, and if you went your entire life just thinking you were a massive weirdo that couldn’t relate to this world. What would it have been like going through life wondering why some things seemed to be so easy for everyone and SO impossibly difficult for you? All of this without having some explanation while you’re just labeled as having all kinds of character flaws.

Just because we’re not “officially diagnosed” it doesn’t mean we don’t struggle with managing it as much as you. Maybe you’ll find this article informative as to why there are lots of people who don’t have an “official diagnosis”.

ADHD,Other,a Head of Product 1,a year,"Those are your opinion, I have mine. I’m going to respond to your points in order:

1) neurodivergent does not mean autistic. Neurodivergence is a broad catchall for mental disorders ranging from ADHD to bipolar to OCD, and encapsulated aberrant behavior/mental faculties that don’t have an official condition or diagnosis. Saying you’re neurodivergent is much different than claiming “undiagnosed autism”

2) women and POC are not the only groups who have been underdiagnosed with autism historically. Now, one could argue that the broad under diagnosis of autism in the 90s provides validity to the idea of self-diagnosis, but self-diagnosis is (optimistically) ~ 75-80% accurate, with several white papers demonstrating accuracies as low as 40%. Self diagnosis is not - clinically valid accreditation of this disorder… it is treated by mental health professionals as a strong cause to undergo an official diagnosis, but ultimately you cannot diagnose yourself with a mental disorder, full stop.

3) ASD is quite literally covered under the ADA. Yes, an official diagnosis does allow you to legally seek accommodation from work.

4)RAADS and AQ are great self diagnosis tools to bring to a professional to justify an official diagnosis process… they are not clinically valid in and of themselves.

5) regarding being gaslighted and blamed for using it as an excuse - that an assumption you are making. Possibly a valid assumption, but still an assumption grounded in opinion and not fact. This is not a valid barrier to seeking an official diagnosis. The money element could be, but most insurance plans do cover diagnosis (employer sponsored and private health care plans).

6) I was diagnosed with Asperger’s when I was a child. That’s just what it is. You have absolutely no cause to treat my diagnosis flippantly just because you disagree with my opinion. You’re right - terminology has changed, but Asperger’s is what the piece of paper that my mother received said. You used quotes to demonstrate a flippant/sarcastic response to my diagnosis. Before you try to deny it… that was your intent, so have the gumption to admit it. Respect is a two way street… something I’d hope you’d have learned in your 50 years.

7) masking is real. But it is also treated quite flippantly by the “self diagnosed” crowd. It’s not a joke or a funny haha thing… it’s a coping mechanism widely established and taught to help someone with ASD assimilate. If you re read my original post, you’ll note that I do not question the validity of masking… rather, I’m pointing out that this term is frequently misused /overused by non ASD individuals, which does a tangible disservice to individuals like myself (of which there are many)

7) Yes, autism is a spectrum. You’re right, maybe life would have been different if I didn’t know what o had. Knowing didn’t bring me comfort or make life easier, however. You have had your experiences, and I have had mine. Don’t you dare try to tell me that my experience was in any way easier because of my diagnosis… you do not know my life, and I do not know yours.

8) that’s a single OpEd from the LA times. That’s a great resource and certainly represents one side of the conversation… there are several other resources (which I’m not going to take the effort to link here but I highly recommend you searching independently) that show the other side of the coin.

Ultimately, it’s clear that there will always be different opinions on a very polarizing topic, and that’s fine. My opinion, however, still stands… wanton overuse of “self diagnosis” does a disservice to individuals with tangible ASD.","3

ADHD,Other,a Freelance Creative 1,a year,"As a creative with diagnosed Aspergers, I failed as a Creative Director. I did well with leading creative and mentoring. My team pushed out some great work, but did miserably with clients and account. I don’t do well with conflict. I ultimately was fired. I recognize I’m unfit to take a leadership role, and honestly don’t want it. Unfortunately, it looks bad when you’re not advancing to the next level at your next opportunity. I’m staying freelance for now.

ADHD,Other,an Art Director 4,a year,"FCB 1 gets it. I have a 16 yo kiddo that has adhd and autism. They stim (physically moves their arms when under stimulated, which is often) and is fully self aware of it…and cannot control it. It’s a disability. My kid struggles in school a lot. Her pitch to other kids is, “I have autism, yeah I’m a little weird, but I’m really nice and I have a good heart if you give me a chance.” Try having your kid say that to your face and not break down crying.

11-12 years ago was a much tougher time to have a kid diagnosed with autism. Do you remember Jenny McCarthy and how her son was diagnosed with autism and then she jumped on the anti vax train? And that’s arguably how anti-vax garbage really took off.

Then everyone went nuts on gluten and tons of people claimed that was why kids were having autistic symptoms. Just go GF and your kid will be cured of autism! It was ridiculous.

Autism was all over the news and the vibe wasn’t that it was okay to be neurodivergent, it was fear because humans fear what they don’t understand.

Today, the use of the term neurodivergence allows for the acknowledgment and space for difference. You’re not someone that needs to be cured because you’re different, you just are. As a parent, I’m grateful. Although the kids are still cruel… maybe you other parents can step it up and teach your kids more empathy and kindness?","17

ADHD,Other,an Art Director 4,a year,"CD2, One example would be in a feedback or decision making situation. Let’s say a neurodivergent person just got a ton of information or was presented with multiple concepts. They have to immediately give feedback or choose a direction to go with in that meeting. That actually might really challenge a neurodivergent. Giving them even a few hours to walk away, process and then articulate a response would be better. I once worked with a CMO that required this, but have also worked with folks who seem to immediately have the best feedback.

Another accommodation might be sensory related. Some folks struggle to tune out their environment. The sound of a fluorescent light might be really loud to them while most people can tune it out. They might do better in a more isolated part of the office or thrive in WFH conditions.","3

I’d love to see how that’d go over with a client. “Sorry, we’re gonna need another day because the CD running your account is neurodivergent.”","2

Where we thrive is the kind of work that offers us the following:
- variety and novelty
- a quick pace or tight, regular deadlines
- a need for problem solving or quick decision making
- situations where we can thrive under pressure
- the ability to have a relatively flexible schedule
- the ability to create systems that suit us
- something that taps into a natural special interest
- something where we can be social if desired

As a result, the top fields we gravitate to are:
- Emergency Services
- Hospitality and Food Service
- Sales and Entrepreneurship
- Computer Engineering and Programming
- Creative Work, such as design, writing and acting

ADHD individuals have many great capabilities and advantages others don’t have and that’s what you want others to see in you. However, if you struggle with attention to details, you might want to consider a job where that is not one of the key responsibilities as you may become frustrated and may not feel successful in your new job. Knowing your strengths and match them up with your personality and job/career are keys.

ADHD,Other,Sigma-Aldrich Corporation 1,10 months,"I disagree. Most jobs require and post “attention to detail.” So by that logic alone, anyone would short change themselves. Personally, I have ADHD and I am medicated for it. I would never disclose that I have it just because anyone between the recruiter, HR, or hiring personnel could take it the wrong way. And besides, you aren’t guaranteed any job, why would you disclose privileged medical information.

Additionally, because I have ADHD, I’ve developed techniques to help myself overcome it. I know what I need to do otherwise, I know what will happen if I do not. You have to be conscientious of it. Employers during the interview stage find ways to weed out candidates and if you disclose your ADHD, it may be misconstrued as a preemptive excuse for poor performance.","3

ADHD,Author,a Marketing 1,10 months,"FWIW I have adhd and have been interviewing recently.

I always take notes by hand during interviews, I rarely mention taking notes but if I do feel the need I simply say I take hand written notes to help me gather my thoughts incase you see me looking down. No one has ever appeared to care.

Some advice that works for anyone but especially with adhd:

1- if the question is hard or unexpected and you don’t know what story to use from what you prepared simply say “that’s a good question, can I take a moment to think about this?”

They will always say yes. Then you can think in silence for about a minute before you answer.

2- if for some reason you don’t want to say “can I have a minute to think?” Another tactic I use is “I want to make sure I understood the question correctly, are you asking XYZ?”

Usually they’ll say yes or they will say yes and then restate the question in a slightly different way. Usually if they restart it they’ll explain a little more and even possibly lead you toward more clearly what they want to learn. So they may repeat the question then basically say “I’m trying to understand how you approach XYZ”

So you get a moment to hear the question again, maybe a little new info, and you’re also hopefully able to think about your answer while you hear the question again.


3- if they are scheduling a bit “full slate of interviews” like 4 of them I have told them “I have adhd, is it possible to do these interviews over 2 days? I’m more than happy to fill out a formal legal request for an accommodation if necessary.”

Usually I’ll also add something like “I won’t be at my best necessarily with the back to back interviews for that many hours due to my adhd. It’s never been an issue though during my actual work schedule but interviews are a different experience.”

They *always* will say yes. Adhd is a legally covered disability in the USA. I had the second part to basically try and make it clear that even if you’re going to have bias I want to let you know this isn’t anything I ask for on the actual job

Anyways, according to the disabilities act, it is considered a disability. So are anxiety, depression, dyslexia, etc. And if an employer fires an employee for having ADHD, they can turn around and sue them for discrimination against their disability. No matter how functional they are, from what I understand.","3

ADHD,Other,a Vice President of Sales 1,a year,"Essentially, with machine learning! There's models that take in aggregate data from basically anywhere where large companies have an online presence. They scour sites like Glassdoor, LinkedIn, Monster, company websites, etc. Along with the company's personal social media to get holistic scores in one direction or the other.

So, for example, let's say I'm a gay man looking for a job. I set the model to pull in data from various companies I am interested in working for. If a company changes their logo for Pride Month, has keywords on their website that identify as positive towards the LGBT community, has a high percentage of employees on LinkedIn with pronoun setting turned on, etc. The machine learning model will flag this with a high cumulative score and let me know this is a great company for me to apply to.

On the other hand, another company had a press release about a hate crime towards gay individuals 2 months ago, glassdoor reviews have keywords that are ""gay negative"", and WARN records indicate a high amount of people with pronouns/identify as gay publicly laid off, this tells me, probably not a good company for me if I openly identify as gay.

ADHD,Other,Authora Legal Assistant,8 months,"She has been struggling with things for many years but we didn’t even think it was anything other than immaturity. She always thinks she knows more than everyone else, she can’t keep friendships or other relationships, she quit three colleges, and can’t keep a job. She doesn’t express feelings and she doesn’t touch people. These things have gotten worse with age, and became much more noticeable to us. But honestly, her mannerisms were much like my mother’s, who died when I was 18. I’m now thinking there might have been an issue with my mother. My daughter is actually the one that told us that she thinks she’s autistic so we paid a lot of money for a diagnosis, which made us all feel better just knowing there were explanations for how she was. We didn’t have a clue before and that makes me feel like an inferior parent for not thinking her behavior could be something else.

My mom didn’t tell me she loved me and my daughter doesn’t either, nor does she hug me, and I honestly thought it was because I did something wrong as a parent.

I’m not trying to make this about me but I’m spinning in guilt for not having had her see someone for a diagnosis when she was younger so we could have gotten her help earlier in life.

ADHD,Other,Accenture 1,8 months,"Don’t beat yourself up. Autism & adhd is very often missed in girls because the diagnosis has been completely based around boys’ behavior. There are only very recent pushes to redefine those standards because they don’t include a lot of the manifestations of autistic girls, who are still very much influenced by sexist social dynamics (thereby making their behavior and diagnosis very different). If doctors have been missing the signs in girls for many years, you definitely can’t be expected to know that.

All that matters is she’s getting help now. 26 is still young. You sound like a very caring parent","23

Being a mom to an autistic person often feels like a thankless, unrewarding job.

Deep down your daughter loves you, she just may not show it.
For a job, maybe she can find something using her strengths, like in a mailroom or stuffing envelopes. There are nonsocial and noncomplex jobs out there.

He suggested what type of work would be best for her and a lot of other things that just overall helped us understand her better. It just made me very sad that we found out that she’s nine years behind developmentally. I want to be alive to see her thrive (as most parents do), so I’m really hoping her attending therapy once a week will continue helping her. This is the only time she’s stayed in therapy. I’ve learned to ask in advance if I can hug her, and sometimes she says no, and I don’t tell her that I love her every day as she gets really overwhelmed by those words and doesn’t know how to respond. You might look up an Autism-related psychiatrist to help you. The diagnosis helps you to keep your child on your medical insurance past the age of 25 and also helps to give them more time on assignments and testing at school.

ADHD,Other,a Customer Service Representative 1,a year,"I have struggled with this my whole life and I feel you! I've always understood it to be an ADHD thing. I have primarily innatentive type, as well as some learning disabilities.

I think it's also tangled up with my perfectionism that wants to do things incredibly thorough and detailed or not at all. I've been coming to terms with my perfectionism and learning about it with podcasts & audiobooks and that's helping.

Another thing that might help is something a psychologist that I met in a bar once told me. She said ""People with ADHD have a difficult time thinking hierarchicaly. They tend to see things as all being on the same feild, making it extremely hard to prioritize one task over another.""

Since then I've talked with other ADHD folks, and I don't think this is true for every person with ADHD, but it sure is true for me. I think it's possibly my #1 struggle. But becoming aware of this has helped me realize that I need to put extra effort into prioritizing.

Some tasks need more time and thoughtfulness. Other tasks can be completed quickly and don't have to be precise. Just doing certain tasks to a ""good enough"" standard can be perfectly fine. Especially if they're balancing them out with the more thorough tasks.

Take some steps to work on prioritization and efficiency. In particular, work to find a balance between perfection vs just completing the task and being able to move on. Look into timeboxing and assess if you’re truly slower or if it’s something else.

ADHD,Other,an Accountant 1,a year,"being aware of information helps us make more informed decisions. i agree

i think part of unraveling the shame is understanding it is not our fault.

i guess maybe i jumped the gun, but the wording of OP makes me think he believes adhd is preventing him from being productive.
and that his coworkers without adhd are productive because they are “normal”

imagine a world where productivity is represented by carrying a box to the top of a hill. ADHD isn’t a wall that prevents you from walking up the hill.

ADHD,Other,a Customer Service Representative 1,a year,"I hear you and it's really hard to tease apart what is our ADHD and what we have more control over. But I want to remind you that ADHD presents itself differently in different people.

For some people their main struggle is staying focused, for some it's prioritizing, for some it's getting motivated, etc.

So it may very well be this person's ADHD that is getting in the way of their productivity. The only way to figure that out is to try different strategies and see what works and compare those results to other strategies that work or don't work.

That's what this person is doing: they're asking for feedback from other ADHD folks to see if they struggle with the same thing and what works for them.","1

As far as I understand, we don't *very much* control our ADHD, we find different ways to work/cope with it. This is why people who didn't know they had ADHD their whole lives suddenly find that they're falling apart after some of their systems disappear (like during the pandemic).

I've written a snippet of how I perceive my ADHD and how knowing I have ADHD actually empowers me (mostly through untangling the shame of feeling like there's something inherently wrong with me vs. there being a reason for my behavior/thoughts/moods).

i started learning about therapy and how it can develop systems and habits to address my adhd symptoms. plus some therapy to accept myself.

i think at this point i separated adhd from the symptoms. The medicine and therapy isn’t to cure adhd, it’s to help you manage the symptoms of it.

Now, sort of unrelated but i end up going on a self improvement spree. I particularly enjoy stoicism and fitness.

Lots of people have opinions on what is best for health and fitness. I prefer a science based approach. Show me the research and then apply that to my routine.

I drop things, My phone is new, got it when I switched companies in May, but I already need a new screen protector, and the day I got the phone, I replaced the company sleeve with an Otterbox one. I've put dozens of coffee mugs and glasses to bins.

Some things helped, of course, but now it's steady - when I log in, I'm productive and get results, things move along.

Thankfully the role I’m in requires me to be able to juggle many tasks and have both breadth and depth of knowledge. So it is easier to see the benefits of my goofy brain than it was when I was a software engineer tasked with one job at a time.

I will say that I think people management is a crucial skill to have if you want to grow your career in accounting, especially your own firm.

IMO client retention is more important than marketing. As long as you gain clients faster than you lose them, you’ll hit capacity eventually. If you strive to give high quality work, I’m confident you can retain clients :)","2

I will say that I think people management is a crucial skill to have if you want to grow your career in accounting, especially your own firm.

IMO client retention is more important than marketing. As long as you gain clients faster than you lose them, you’ll hit capacity eventually. If you strive to give high quality work, I’m confident you can retain clients :)",2,2024-09-17 21:16:57,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/any-sr-mgrs-with-asd-andor-adhd-how-have-you-overcome-such-symptoms-as-difficulties-with-communicationconnecting-with,1,9,120

ADHD,Other,a Vice President 1,a year,"My guess is that you are projecting a bit. Did they say “I’ll fail them unless you Medicate,” or “I have to fail them if you don’t get them on some medication.”
The latter means the kid is failing but the teacher will hold the grade if there are extenuating circumstances.
My guess is this is private school. Else you would just say so and not be fearful of reprisal?
Unless you have in writing threats, you may just be painted as that parent who failed to hear many softer warnings in your kid’s performance and issues son this teacher is going nuclear. If it’s private school you may find yourself counseled out.
The “use this clinic or else” thing is weird. I’d love to know how it was worded. It may be that they work with the school if that they know you won’t get in anywhere else quickly or anything.
I know your parent hackles are up, mine would be too, but try to settle them and look at it again and see if you are actually being threatened or are just being shaken in hopes you will wake up and help your kid.","4

ADHD,Other,a VP 1,a year,"To add on to my previous post above-

ADHD is a cognitive disorder, and a common one. It affects ~9.8% of people. That’s basically 1 in 10. So it is naive to think it is a rare and horrible thing. It’s also genetic so if someone in your family has it, odds are

As well, again, it is a cognitive disorder of the actual function of the brain. No amount of “sitting down and having a talk with your child” will EVER change it, ever. You don’t have magic powers no matter how good of a parent you are.

Early intervention and therapy and managing those skills and impulses will help significantly. You may be able to avoid medication.

But also, the firestorm inside your child’s brain can potentially be controlled externally through therapy alone, but doesn’t help with the constant firing of synapses. So don’t just think meds = bad. I was off them for 10 years as an adult, I’m back on now and wish I never stopped, and how much more successful I could be if I never got off.

It is this horrible stigma, that leaves young adults swirling and all kinds of messed up with self doubt about hearing they “have so much potential” or are called “lazy and procrastinate”. When all it took was a little bit of recognition, that that it’s a daily struggle and there are resources to help.

A parents pride is not worth the impact it could have to a child’s entire life.",1,2024-09-17 21:17:25,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/background-precocious-8-yo-hyper-but-average-for-many-kids-the-same-age-challenge-teacher-pushing-for-addadhd-screening,1,10,178

ADHD,Other,Intelsat 1,7 months,"Sorry to hear this. I can only imagine how defeating and overwhelming it must be.

Have you gotten a second opinion on the ADHD? Only asking because sometimes anxiety is misdiagnosed with ADHD and if she’s on medication, it can certainly make it worse. Highly suggest a comprehensive psych eval from a specialized psychologist (especially if original diagnosis came from a PCP or someone not qualified - I’ve seen a lot of PCPs throwing the diagnosis around when it really shouldn’t come from them).

If her dx is still aligned with ADHD, maybe a switch in meds can help. It’s never the end all be all of course but getting some level of stability will help facilitate the other necessary strategies and coping skills. I assume she’s already seeing a therapist regularly to build to her own coping skills? If not, that’s an absolute must. Parents need to be equipped to provide support but the child’s “tool box” to handle situations is critical to her success.

Also see if there’s a pattern of when her “outbursts” or “defiance” is worse, like at school or home and what her triggers are to see if things can be narrowed down to come up with specific support strategies for each situation.

Wishing you all the best.",21,2024-09-17 21:17:39,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/im-at-a-loss-and-maybe-i-just-need-a-express-my-frustration-i-am-a-step-parent-to-one-beautiful-8-yr-girl-for-4-years-now-shes,1,11,197

ADHD,Other,Ohio Middle School 1,7 months,"So, obviously there is no one size fits all. Having gone through this with one of my own, I can understand what it’s like. I’d taught neurotypical and neurodivergent kiddos for over 15 years before going through this with mine so you’d think this should have been easy. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Even knowing that you need help, doesn’t mean you’ll find the right help for your child right away. I’ll share some of the hardest lessons. First, find a holistic psychiatrist or psych nurse practitioner. Some one who will ask you questions about their behaviors, foods, and wants a full history. Some one who will run a complete blood panel that looks at thyroid, vitamin deficiencies, and other physical causes first. If they can do a genetics test that looks at which medicines are better suited for your daughter in addition to looking for gene mutations, do this! It will save you years of frustration, if meds are needed. Additionally, part of the issue may be helped by gettin. YnAvoid in patient/ partial hospitalization programs if at all possible. The idea of these programs are great, however, the reality is that you’re child may encounter kids who are worse off than them and come home with bigger issues (ie: cutting, suicidal ideation, language th at t would make a sailor blush) than they went into the program with. The biggest piece of advice, educate yourself about parenting a tween with ADHD, Anxiety, or whatever the diagnoses may be. You are you’re child’s parent and advocate.
When having a difficult moment, focus on the behavior and not the person (this can be tough because you are human too).

ADHD,Other,a Field Project Manager 1,7 months,"Is their an ex involved? Any possibility the kid is experiencing parental alienation on that side?

I'm in a situation where the worst behavior is directed at me. Almost all of her struggles can be traced to the fact that her dad and grandmother actively try to alienate me from her.

Hopefully that's not your situation, but when that's the source it can be extremely hard to combat the gaslighting from the other home and support their mental health. We have made a lot of progress, but the kid is basically dragging an anchor and it's a slow march to better times.

One of my daughters has her own struggles but my ex has embraced my partner and actively includes her in our co-parenting. Seeing the clear impact an oppositional co-parent has on a kid was eye opening for me. It's like her hands are tied behind her back as she learns to cope with life and handle her own emotions.",2,2024-09-17 21:17:40,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/im-at-a-loss-and-maybe-i-just-need-a-express-my-frustration-i-am-a-step-parent-to-one-beautiful-8-yr-girl-for-4-years-now-shes,1,11,218
ADHD,Other,a Laboratory Technician 1,7 months,"Is there a possibility of parental alienation. I have a SS8 and SD7 (almost 7) and my SS has autism and SD suspected ADHD as both her dad and my wife have it. Behavioral therapy and time helped SS coping, but he still has meltdowns. SD7 this last year was really REALLY misbehaved and ever since and before I've been in their lives (4 years), their father has alienated them from us. He tells them terrible lies about my wife and says things that make them feel guilty to come to our home (which he says they only have one home).

All this to say that if you believe you are taking a healthy approach and experiencing no change, then I'd look into how her life is with the other parent (if they're in the picture).

ADHD,Other,Humana 1,7 months,"Primary care physician did not dx my daughter with ADHD. She’s on Adderall and when they initially put her on it, I said how is this child sleeping when she’s on an amphetamine. But with those with ADHD it has the opposite effect. She’s a young adult trying to finish high school and then go on to her next steps. After finally getting dx’d, she’s had an appendectomy and her gallbladder removed. Probably not related but we have been dealing with stomach issues for about the same length of time. It took several therapist and psychologists to find someone she liked. She’s habitually late everywhere we go and I have a running joke with her that she’ll be late to her own wedding. One of her high school teachers had a child with ADHD and she was a godsend. She was on a 504 individual education plan (IEP) but I took her out to homeschool because most teachers weren’t redirecting her in class or giving her the extra time she was supposed to get. Even after dx had some teachers call her lazy. Easier to homeschool than deal with the school’s inaction and it’s allegedly a top tier school and it was to the point where I was going to lodge a complaint with the state’s department of education.

ADHD,Other,PwC 1,6 months,"I think this needs to be looked at separately for those 2 categories - There are those taking medication for mental health (ADHD meds, anti-anxiety meds, etc.) who aren’t necessarily taking them because of this job, but would need them regardless due to having a diagnosable mental health matter. Separately, there are definitely people who get those types of meds, that are undiagnosed or may not be struggling with that mental health matter, specifically to keep up with work or perform better.

People who are on medication because they’ve been diagnosed typically won’t fall into the “zombie” category since they actually need those medications to function at the level of their peers without those diagnoses. I’m no doctor, but as someone with diagnosed ADHD, taking my medication is the only way I can get through the day sometimes.

*just qualifying that for sure there are also people who are diagnosed but who feel like a zombie when on meds, but from my experience with ADHD medication specifically, my focus levels just become more equivalent to non-ADHD people rather than making me feel like a zombie",3,2024-09-17 21:18:18,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/im-curious-how-many-people-working-in-accounting-are-taking-prescription-medications-for-their-mental-health-andor-to,1,12,225

Another strategy I’ve found that works but hasn’t been mentioned yet is getting up really early. Now let me preface this by saying I am not and never will be a natural morning person. I am still a night owl. But I’ve trained myself to get up and it has had a huge productivity impact. Because the thing about early morning is, there are no distractions. There can’t be. The world is still on pause.

Many folks accomplish this the other way by staying up late. I used to do that too. But while you might start off a little tired in the AM, your body ultimately wants to get to a place of alertness. The reverse it true of late nights.

ADHD,Other,a VP 1,9 months,"Ok- GREAT question. And apologies in advance for the long winded ADHD-induced response:

Some background context; 15 years in pharma advertising (which is certainly on the more boring side of advertising). I was diagnosed in elementary school, ran through the gauntlet of meds and therapy over 25 years. I took myself off meds after college (didn’t like how it tampered my personality because I was the “fun guy”, which was stupid). did 10 years in the industry without any, and halfway through COVID/Quarantine went back on and kicking myself for not doing it earlier.

1- it’s better to be open about it. There are more of us that have it then you think. Opening that door so you know how to work with people and vice versa helps tremendously. I have someone that works under me with it also. I know that I can recognize when they’re firing on all cylinders and toss as much as I can at them, then back off when I can tell they hit their limit. They are one of the strongest people on our team and wildly productive while they are on the surge swing.

I also have a client that has it, and I’ve become an invaluable resource to them in how to recognize when things get overwhelming and how to move forward.

2- PLAY TO YOUR STRENGTHS. This doesn’t mean don’t work on your weaknesses, which is a sizable amount of what we have to do. Use the livewire hyper-focus and out of box thinking to do your absolute best at what you’re good at. Even if you fall short in other areas, the examples of good can outweigh the others while you’re working on it.

Try to set yourself up to have people not disturb you until you finish a big task. Those “quick questions” can break your flow.

Again, if your managers are aware of your condition, it can help them understand where to allow you to focus on your strengths more often. (If they are terrible people and punish you for it, that’s a discrimination lawsuit lol)

I imagine brainstorming sessions are a big strength for most.

3- make systems work for you- agency organization and process doesn’t always make sense, create your own worksheets and systems that work for you, but that feed into the main system to make your life easier.

4- schedules and reminders- set up as many as you possibly can. Also create false early deadlines for yourself to capitalize on that “last minute anxiety surge” and get things done before the due date. RIDE that surge also, if you’re feeling up, knock out everything you possibly can off your plate.

5- meds and therapy; try starting both. Figure out what type of meds work best for you, and try starting CBT style therapy. Meds can help smooth the runway while you’re in therapy. If you are able to get lower or get of meds after therapy then great, but don’t look at them like a burden if they help you.

Insurance sucks for $50 copays every week for therapy, but some agencies and insurance like Aetna cover AbleTo, which is an affordable 8-week CBT program with local licensed therapists.

6- we’re all different and different things work for different people. Examples:

Body-doubling (when you have someone near by while you work) helps some people. Complete opposite for me, people are distracting lol. Hot desk open floor plan is my chaos nightmare so I sit away from the action when in office when I can help it.

I always refer to the part of my brain that’s the “second motor” that’s always searching for something. That’s why it’s hard to focus on one thing. So I try to pre-occupy that second part of my brain (it’s the same concept why they give us fidget spinners). Doodle while taking notes, I have TV on a familiar movie in The background while I clean my house, listen to instrumental music while working to drown out the world.

I use instrumental music because if I hear lyrics I 100% will start typing them. I’m a 90s-00s grunge, rap, metal guy, but classical all the way while I work. If you’re like me, try Vitamin String Quartet that plays modern music in classical instrumental style.

Trial and error, learn about yourself and apply it.",2,2024-09-17 21:18:51,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/agency-people-with-adhd-how-do-you-function-contd,1,13,290

ADHD,Other,Accenture 1,10 months,"Can I ask why you’re seeking out the negative experiences only?

I was on it for a year, off it for another year(mostly) and now I’m back on it again.
In the beginning taking meds was great because it basically showed my brain that I CAN concentrate for longer periods of time which led to me getting off the medication and being able to concentrate & get into the zone no problem.
After a while though(like 5 months) it can get a bit hard to get back into the zone which is why I’m back on it now.

-the first year was on Ritalin and would completely crash around 6pm, basically a zombie, also had some terrible headaches.

-Now I’m on a longer release one and it works great, no major complaints or side effects.

Personally, I like the idea of taking when needed. Some days are harder than others to concentrate without the meds 🤷🏻‍♀️ I just fuel up on coffee for those days.

ADHD,Other,a Senior Manager 1,10 months,"So it’s not my performance that is the problem. It’s my focus. Adderall quiets the other voices/emotional response that keeps me from being able to deal with the task at hand.

For example if I need to put away the laundry:
With adderall: I just fold/hang my clothes.

Without adderall: man I should have taken this to the dry cleaners, I don’t think this looks good any more, I should figure out how to sew so I can fix that, I need to put away my winter cloths, I wore this when I broke up with …, wow that sucked, but I deserve better, but do I? I can’t seem to date anyone successfully in years….

Like it’s never just the task. It’s the whole rabbit holes my mind wants to go into that keeps me from focusing. Adderall doesn’t make me a better/more productive person. I’m not Superhuman when I’m on it, it’s just me without distraction.","2

ADHD,Other,a National Functional Support Manager 1,10 months,"I was late diagnosed and came to a point in my life where I couldn’t manage my anxiety. I had always been a little intense and prone to migraines, burnout…then came panic attacks. A common issue with late adhd diagnoses is it becomes a behavioral issue at some point in life.

I went into my adulthood thinking I was always in lala-land and that was part of my personality. I started to use humor as a way to make up for my insecurities. Now…I’m too goofy for this promotion.

I couldn’t work my way out of issues I was having and was finally diagnosed. Medication helped me take this bowl of thoughts and put them into a linear order so I could work my way out of depression. You do have to seek therapy and learn coping mechanisms that work for you. Medication helps with that but I know I can’t stay on it forever. Especially with the shortage- I had to figure out alternatives in supplements (l-tyrosine and b-vitamins). Medication is a tool but you need a Swiss Army knife of tools to work with your specific brand of adhd",1,2024-09-17 21:19:31,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/adults-taking-adhd-medication-what-are-your-negative-experiences-curious-to-know-about-any-long-term-considerationsmore-info-in,1,14,325

ADHD,Other,an Associate 2,8 months,"Yes, this is me too! Diagnosed last year as a fourth-year lit associate. My life makes so much sense in hindsight now as I see all the signs that were missed. I suspect a lot of high-achievers don’t fit the “typical” ADHD profile and go undiagnosed until later in life. No one suspected I had it because I always got good grades (was valedictorian, etc.) and can focus intensely under pressure. It was also masked by the fact that I can focus on things I like (like school, back in the day). It took me a while to realize that my hyperfocus is also a symptom. ADHD is a difficulty with attention regulation, not necessarily a “deficit” of attention.

I was already seeing a (very perceptive) psychiatrist for other mental health issues and he told me point-blank that he thought I had it. It floored me at the time because I thought that my ability to edit a brief for 18 straight hours with no breaks ruled out any sort of attentional difficulty.",11,2024-09-17 21:19:54,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/formally-diagnosed-with-adhd-after-several-years-in-big-law-and-several-years-of-thinking-i-had-it-but-could-somehow-focus-on,1,15,328

ADHD,Other,a Partner 1,3 months,"Disagree here - I’m in M&A and I think the project-based work with short deadlines and time crunches pairs pretty well with ADHD. Lateral thinking and creative problem solving are also major benefits as you get more senior.

The issue is surviving years 1 and 2 where there job is almost entirely organization - but that’s really every legal job to some extent.

If you can brute force your way through those early years, the job is actually really well tailored to ADHD.","3

I would also suggest finding a good organizational system that works for you personally - ideally something that allows you to break big assignments into smaller tasks (like a closing checklist, but for everything!).

ADHD,Other,a Director of Operations 1,7 months,"Some days do require us to be more gentle with ourselves. Are you familiar with “spoon theory”?
Basically everyone wakes up in the morning with a certain amount of spoons (or coins, tokens, pick your metaphor)
Everything we do either costs or earns spoons. Petting a neighbor’s dog on your way to the car +1 spoon
Long commute -2 spoons
Work bestie brings you coffee +3 spoons
Taking a tense meeting -5 spoons

If you overspend without replenishing, you end up borrowing from the next day, so you wake up with a “low balance”.

Try to figure out what you’re doing that’s costing you and what activities, people, snacks, etc can replenish you.
Simplify your routine so that just getting ready for the day doesn’t spend too much.
Replenish yourself after costly tasks.
Advocate for yourself when you’re in or approaching spoon debt. “I know you need this report urgently.

ADHD,Other,a Proposal Project Manager/technical Writer 1,7 months,"1. Make a written to-do list. Crossing off is very satisfying, plus writing it out gives you the cognitive break of not taxing your working memory.

2. Promise yourself a reward for a certain amount of the task done.

3. Try a sprint: agree with yourself to sit down for 5 or 10 minutes (literally, pick a very short amount of time!) and see what you can accomplish, even if it’s just opening a document or spreadsheet.

You will be surprised how many time this small amount of effort can “catch fire” so that you want to keep going after the 10 minutes. If you don’t want to keep going, stop. Write down the next two to three steps you should take. Now take a break and try another sprint in 15 or 20 or 30 minutes.

3. When making your written to-do list, break your task(s) into the smallest size step you can think of, e.g., open a Word document. The chunks you break your task into should NOT contain substeps or multiple steps. If they do, you need to break into smaller chunks.

4. Take frequent breaks.

5. Visualize success. When you’ve made your list, close your eyes and mentally rehearse completing each step. Many ADHD professionals advise this. I do it, and I think it helps.

Hope some of this is useful. Good luck! I will post more when I can.",16,2024-09-17 21:20:44,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/fellow-adhd-heroes-can-you-tell-me-some-tips-and-tricks-to-get-into-the-groove-relatively-quick-that-have-anecdotally-worked-some,1,17,388

Because we ADHDers forget what we accomplish in a day, we forfeit the satisfaction/brain rewards from all we've done during the day.

You could try a situation like that. To keep yourself interested and invested in conversation, you could be the one to start, about a topic you like- just make sure to engage the other person, perhaps by asking their opinion on it. Smalltalk also works, you can try eventually relating other topics into that conversation to shift the focus without dropping the chat off. You can even try this on customers first, before trying it on coworkers- if things don't go well at first, any one customer is just an occasional visitor, while a coworker will routinely be back.

When I was a cashier, I'd pick an item out of the customer's cart and make it a topic of conversation to avoid awkward silences.

ADHD,Other,The Walt Disney Company 1,10 months,"Hey there!

I have the same mental “issues” you have but way older than you. I didn’t even know about these issues until last year.

I have been a top performer due to my diligence, conscientiousness, and openness. Sometimes I do tend to overextend myself to exhaustion (forcing myself to be in social situations even though I really just want to go home and watch Netflix or play video games)

The best advice I could give is fake it til you make it, but know your limits, which you already do.

Growth comes from getting out of your comfort zone.

When you said “it’s very hard to convince myself to” - you have this internal argument with yourself. You said you WANT to, yet you are still in the process of “convincing” yourself. That to me is like “well even if I don’t want to I really don’t have to”

You know how muscular people get fit? It’s because they lifted weights probably 2-3x a week. They’ve put in the work. They didn’t have those muscles before, but now they do.

You know how people become great at what they do, whether it’s art, science, or math? Because they’ve dedicated some time and focus to hone their skills or solve problems.

Is it always enjoyable? Maybe for a few.. and by a few, perhaps less than 5% of them… but the lesson here is that being “social” is a skill that you can learn.

If you want a shortcut though, you can use “nootropics” or “mushroom coffee” or some of the racetams… or psychedelics lol.

Truth of the matter is we are all wired a certain way that makes it harder for us to do some things that are easy for others. You probably have skills that are hard to do for others as well. It’s just about exploring those avenues that you haven’t explored yet - whether or not having your brain rewired by a drug, by an event, or anything that you haven’t done before.

The important thing is to remind yourself that just because you have ADHD and autism, it limits you from what you can do. You certainly can. You just need to tell yourself you’re going to do what you “want” to do and you’ll actually do it. It’s okay to fail, just don’t quit and keep trying.",3,2024-09-17 21:21:48,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/im-a-19-year-old-with-high-anxiety-and-depression-as-well-as-a-mentally-disabled-individual-namely-adhd-and-autism-im-generally,1,20,453

ADHD,Other,KPMG 1,10 months,"Spoken like a true neurotypical. It's helpful to understand why your experience differs from the vast majority. Should not be used as an excuse, I fully agree - just disregarding it as a label makes no sense. Knowing you are on the spectrum helps to identify your deficiencies and work with them through proven methods such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.","7

ADHD,Other,KPMG 1,10 months,"Yet you do. Everyone and their mom is self-diagnosing, which does not take away from the <5% of us which have been diagnosed for a long time by a psychiatrist because our childhood experiences were fundamentally different and more challenging than our peers. Shit just doesn't click the same in this funky old brain of mine. That can be a superpower but also brings a lot of isolation.

Knowing that my mirror neurons are less active, and that my brain is not functioning the same, helps me to understand why I face these challenges. That is then the starting point to work on them, not to accept it and ask others to facilitate my mental disabilities à la TikTok in 2023.

I have moved on the spectrum through learned behaviors, and my symptoms are far less debilitating after 10+ years of intense cognitive behavioral therapy. Had I not been diagnosed and received that guidance, I would not even have finished high school.

Don't just disregard people who say they are autistic with those comments. It's a bit of a trigger for sure, hence this rant, but it fits in our usual experience - functioning in society does not come to neurodiverse people the same way as it does to you, nor do you understand that, let alone the biological reason as to why we are so different.","5

ADHD,Other,Microsoft 1,10 months,"What an unhelpful comment. Could you imagine saying something like this about another disability? It is a scientific fact that brains with ADHD and autism are different. That doesn't mean they are lesser, but it does mean that the neurotypical world is not set up best to help people who are neurodivergent. Those of us who know our diagnoses are better set up to create a life that works best for our needs and skills. OP, knowing yourself is the first step! What has been helping me is getting to know more about why I react in certain ways to certain triggers and what motivates me (newness, risk, deadlines, challenge).","5

ADHD,Other,a Manager 2,10 months,"I lived a long time with a neurodivergent issue that went undiagnosed. The confusion and torment I went through for over a decade, trying to figure out why I couldn’t perform to my perceived potential, caused some very serious safety issues and concerns to my mental well-being. OP isn’t making excuses or labeling, they are looking to accept themselves and use the wisdom of others who are like them (or close to others with similar experiences) to find some light and a path to their self-determined abilities, goals and achievement potential. Saying “stop being your diagnosis and just be normal” is damaging and honestly negligent. I hope you can do some serious self reflection - maybe OP can help you, since they seem much more self-aware and empathetic.","7

This helps us to stop comparing when we know what we bring to the table.
I love that others have encouraged medication but I also want to encourage therapy. Group therapy can be especially helpful to improve social confidence

ADHD,Other,KPMG 1,7 months,"Sorry if it came across wrong, was just in case. I have ADHD (diagnosed in my 30s), so it’s possible. But having had burnout and observed it in others I would say they can be so similar. I’d recommend starting with meditation practice, increase your salt and water, make sure you have some screen free time ideally outside walking each day. If you can take a couples days off and make a weekend a 4-5 day block off I’d do that. Then see if things are improving a bit and go from there. Sometimes we just need to away and breathe!","4

The specifics vary depending on your state, so it's important to research the laws and regulations applicable in your area.

What does it mean to quit a job with good cause?

In general, I’ve been really interested (hyper focused?) on technical things so that helps too, though I wonder if I would have succeeded more at my job and school if I’d had the tools to mitigate my lack of focus, etc. I’ve had some cases at work where people think my constant movement is weird but like.. it isn’t a problem so idk.",1,2024-09-17 21:38:17,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/i-was-33-when-i-was-first-diagnosed-with-adhd-before-that-i-had-no-clue-what-my-problem-was-and-it-was-frustrating-i-feel-like,1,24,126
ADHD,Other,a Customer Service Representative 1,4 months,"If it makes you guys feel better, I was 8 years old when I got diagnosed and started medication at 10. My parents helped me try multiple medications until we found one with the least amount of side effects, took me to counseling, got me special accommodations etc and I feel very fortunate for that but it also came with a lot of stigma being in the 90’s. It helped overall academically, but it really affected my ability to make friends and made me feel like an outsider, and further contributed to my self esteem issues. I was underweight, due to the meds restricting my appetite and am guessing I would have grown a couple more inches otherwise. I also went through a rebellious period where I didn’t take my medication from 14-15 and then in later years dropped out of college twice from selling my medication to friends for beer money instead of taking it myself. There were a lot of other issues surrounding my medication, but just wanted to give you guys a little sense of how being medicated that early also had its downsides and sometimes the grass seems greener but the reality is you are going to be at a disadvantage with ADHD no matter when you are diagnosed.

ADHD,Other,a Customer Service Representative 1,4 months,"I was 7, and while I got some treatment, I didn't get the knowledge or treatment that I needed. It's hard to say whether my early diagnosis was helpful. I still struggled in school a lot, but my mum coddled me and helped me get good grades (luckily I have higher-than-average intelligence - without that I think I would have been a lot worse off). I started denying my diagnosis as a teenager, was a wayward youth and wound up going to a reform school. None of these things were particularly helpful.

I wasted a lot of time in my late teens and early twenties trying to will myself to do the things, without much success. I only started to accept that I actually had ADHD in my late twenties when I tried to go to university, but had to take 2 hardship withdrawals because my mum was sick with cancer.

I had a rocky start with trying meds again, partially because I bought into the stigma against them. I'm now 40 and I've really only been successful with dialing in my meds & treatment for the last 5 years. I've only ever worked entry-level jobs that are ultimately unfulfilling and have left me essentially in poverty. That's partially because I've essentially refused to work office jobs, plus I won't work for corporations or organizations that don't share my values. And I need to be authentically engaged in things to be successful, which has made things more difficult, but I also know myself pretty well at this point and haven't spent my life trying too hard to fit myself into boxes (although I definitely still do this some). But I honestly think I have some PTSD from having to switch jobs about 20 times & move 15 times in the last 10 years.

Yet I have an immense amount of potential and when I find the right fit I think I'm going to absolutely thrive. I'm finally going to go back to school to get my bachelor's degree in the fall. Part of the reason why I waited this long is because I was terrified because I think school might have been traumatic for me in the past. But I'm properly medicated & treated now, and everyone's telling me that older students tend to be more successful. I'm hoping to go into ecological restoration and I'm very excited!

All of this is to say: there's absolutely no way to know how an earlier diagnosis might have benefitted you or not. There's a lot of light being shone on ADHD & neurodivergent folks that wasn't happening even 5 years ago. There's a lot less people who deny that ADHD is a valid diagnosis and that meds can be life-changing for some people. When I was growing up there wasn't nearly as much info going around that would have helped me make sense of what was going on with me and how it related to my life and the world.

So, perhaps an earlier diagnosis would have been helpful. But there's also a chance that it might not have been all that helpful, such as in my case. So I think it's better just to start where you are, learn from the past and let it go. You still have your life ahead of you and you are empowered with knowledge to make as successful as you can. Best of luck with everything! 🍀 You got this.",2,2024-09-17 21:38:18,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/i-was-33-when-i-was-first-diagnosed-with-adhd-before-that-i-had-no-clue-what-my-problem-was-and-it-was-frustrating-i-feel-like,1,24,130

ADHD,Other,an UX Designer 1,8 months,"You probably have friends that do it. Just try to think about which of your friends are the “artsy” ones that go to late parties every once in a while. There’s like a 75% chance they do it or at least they know where to get you some.

You could also go to like a local fungi meetup and someone there will 100% have some maybe even on them.

Or go to your local edm club and dance around with a few people until they trust you enough to share their source.

If someone gives you LSD tab, liquid or gel. Get a testing kit to make sure it’s not some other random research chemical. I use testing kits from https://dancesafe.org

You don’t really need to test mushrooms, either they work or they’re food. It’s really unlikely that anyone will give you poisonous shrooms.","3

ADHD,Other,a DOG Trainer 1,9 months,"I don’t know if you can really say you can beat ADHD. The older I get the more manageable it gets however, I’m females so menopause also puts monkey wrench in ADHD. Maybe change your mindset to not beating it but embracing it. I am a business owner and so now rather than having to grind because I have to. Now I grind because I love what I’m doing. Being hyper focused on something is huge use that to your advantage. Rather than procrastinating, having harsh deadlines that you have to meet. Embrace the fact that you like changing your environment but hate systems that change.

I also have an autoimmune disease that doesn't have a specific treatment (and I don't want to take general immune suppressants), but it does get much better at the same time as the ADHD, provided I stick to the following highly restrictive diet:

No sugar, very little dairy, no alcohol, no gluten, only occasional potato/carrot/corn.

In the morning I have 1 oat milk latte and yogurt with flax and nutritional yeast for the omega-3s and B vitamins. I make a point of having a fatty fish for lunch often. At night I take magnesium and Neuralli, as well as the occasional ashwagandha pill. The thing that's made the biggest difference beside the diet is weirdly the Neuralli, which is just a fancy probiotic. Like it fixed my sleep and cured my depression pretty much instantly, although it also gave me headaches for the first month or so.

ADHD,Other,an Associate 3,a year,"I actually disagree with this. Many women in particular are diagnosed with anxiety and/or depression rather than ADHD. As ADHD symptoms in women are different and come out different. I was diagnosed with those prior to get a diagnosis for ADHD. In my case, it was possible that I had ADHD because the results for when I was younger were inconclusive and my mother was in denial that something was wrong with her child. I’ve adopted several coping skills over the years but at some point they didn’t work once I want in an environment that suddenly wanted more from me. Also, if one of your parent has adhd then you are 50% like to have it to from what I’ve heard. Also, if you add the fact that most POC don’t believe in mental health services then you have people walking around undiagnosed everyday. Sooooo chill","3

ADHD is a developmental disorder. If you were not effected enough to warrant intervention until you got to a a job where you were expected to have inhuman levels of concentration you don’t have an executive function problem, you have a capitalism problem.

It sounds like you were diagnosed as a child, you did not make it through law school without a problem, your mother just ignored your diagnosis.","2

ADHD,Other,an Associate 9,a year,"Agreed that ADHD doesn’t appear for the first time in adulthood, but that absolutely does not mean that making it through law school means you don’t have it…

I was never able to focus on a lecture my entire life. Never took notes ever in classes and honestly just skipped class a ton throughout school because they weren’t useful to me. I still succeeded in law school because I could do the readings when I had the focus for it and that was enough. In the working world, you don’t get to wait for hyperfocus days to get your work done.

ADHD,Other,an Associate 8,a year,"All I’m saying is be very cautious about taking amphetamines based on an adult diagnosis for a life long disorder. There are absolutely bad actors out there over diagnosing and over prescribing.

It’s highly, highly unlikely that someone as academically high achieving as a big law attorney made it through life with no need for amphetamines until their late 20s and now all of a sudden cannot function without them. Most of school is executive function.

Please read the side effects on your medications before you take them. I’m betting they include psychosis. As someone who has seen that happen, believe me these meds are not worth this job.","3

ADHD,Other,an Attorney 1,a year,"On the other hand, this could be completely wrong. Much of the LSAT caters to short attention spans. Law schools grade on a forced curve making it VERY HARD not to pass.

And, of course, you may have had no idea to even ask whether you have ADHD or another condition. Like I didn't. I was 37 years old when I finally found out that my understanding of ADHD was wrong, that it actually reflects exactly my struggles with focus and motivation, and that the way my brain works is NOT typical. It is ENTIRELY possible to have a blind spot here and succeed to some extent; and still to have your mental life vastly improved by an accurate diagnosis and treatment. Like mine was.

Yes, get a diagnosis and discuss with your doctor, don't just jump into medications. Definitely don't forego asking because you passed law school and landed a good job. That's an awful suggestion.","2

ADHD,Other,an Associate 12,a year,"No. Some people have been able to manage their symptoms (via masking, etc) dor decades during school and even early on in their careers - I remember pulling all nighters for exams, etc., growing up. You rely on the adrenaline rush of a deadline to get xyz task accomplished. This can even be a bit useful in BL in some instances - due to the last minute nature of our jobs. But as you get older, some of these coping mechanisms start to crumble. All nighters become incredibly difficult to manage or pull off. Relying on stress/adrenaline/anxiety to get a task done is not emotionally or physically healthy. There are a multitude of reasons why people get diagnosed later on life.

I am sure there are some people who do not have ADHD and should not be on medication. But when taken in proper dosage (and under medical supervision), medication and other techniques are meant to help manage symptoms, not ""solve"" or ""cure"" them completely. Meds are NOT meant to be, nor are they for a majority of ADHD patients, a magic pill to ""make you focus for 16+hrs"".

If you don't have ADHD, it's hard to understand the dynamic at play. Some have beating themselves up for years thinking they are ""lazy"" or ""unmotivated"" or ""failing"" because of the ways their symptoms manifest. When really a lot of those symptoms are tied to their brain chemistry and an imbalance there!",,2024-09-17 21:39:48,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/adhd-in-big-law-late-20s-i-decided-to-seek-help-and-was-properly-diagnosed-and-offered-medication-did-you-find-going-down,9,27,225
ADHD,Other,an Associate 8,a year,"I’m loving all of the people who are quick to say I’m wrong and then immediately list all of the ways in which they were not okay before their diagnosis.

My brother, who was diagnosed in childhood and nearly flunked out of middle school even with them, had a psychotic break due to his meds last year. He undoubtedly needs meds to function, he is not an edge case. That doesn’t change that he was taking meth and it almost caused him to murder his wife.

If y’all cannot recognize that the meds you are taking are serious business and should not be taken lightly, you have no business taking them. If you got along fine into your 30s for one poster, seriously consider a lifestyle adjustment instead of an amphetamine.

So incredibly intelligent people, empathetic people, and those socialised to fit in and behave well and not be a burden often just power through their ADD fueled by anxiety. Then when you mix in actual anxiety and life stress it just becomes too much.

ADHD,Other,an Associate Marriage and Family Therapist 1,7d,"I invite everyone to reflect on ADHD as a learning difference, often called an invisible disability, similar to how physical accommodations like ramps are necessary for those with mobility challenges. By normalizing neurodivergence, we can move away from shame and embrace individuality. There shouldn’t be a rigid ""norm"" because it prevents authenticity. Approaching employers about ADHD without feeling shame can foster understanding and even highlight its benefits. With proper education, workplaces can appreciate the strengths of ADHD, such as the ability to work intensely, explore various solutions, and strive for excellence in unique ways.",9,2024-09-17 21:41:33,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/i-was-just-diagnosed-with-adhd-and-am-now-working-on-how-to-best-manage-it-at-work-now-that-i-understand-my-challenges-better-is,1,31,342
ADHD,Other,a Recreation Therapy Aide 1,7d,"I totally agree with you. Again, Mental Health/Ilness is frowned upon, and carries with it a stigmatism, which it should not. I've seen a therapist, who along with my regular medical, doctor and my psychiatrist, and psychologist, reccomended a therapeutic regimen of medication, nutrients for the brain, that I was not getting, which was part of what was going on for me when diagnosed with ADHD., along with trauma, from losing my Spouse, of 26 year's suddenly. Wellbutrin at 150, mg., the lowest dose, which works great for me, with very minimal, side effects. As far as informing your Supervisor, it's truly up to you, your relationship, with them, and if you feel they'll be supportive, or not. I shared, because with ADHD , I tend to have trouble staying on task, and focusing at times. Not to use for an excuse, but basically, it is, what it is. My Supervisor is very supportive, and when she sees days that I'm struggling, we have a chat because she wants to offer assistance, not to write me up. It's very important to have that type of Culture and Work environment, that's is not toxic. That can definitely causevalot ofvstress and mental anguish. Now sharing your private, personal information should not be shared with anyone else in the office, unless you share. Otherwise, your Supervisor, if informed, should be aware if they share with your co-worker's, etc., It's a direct violation. Check out this book, ADHD Advantage, by Dale Archer, MD. This helped me tremendously, to realize it's not a disability, it's actually an added benefit. Our brains think faster, as we tend to have more, Outside the Box, thinking. I got it on Audible, so I can sit back, relax, and take it all in. Enjoy.","3

ADHD,Other,a Manager of Revenue Cycle Optimization 1,4d,"I’ve turned my ADHD into a win in my career by finding a way to work that partners with some of my ADHD traits. I hyper focus on details a lot, and can get caught going down the rabbit hole of “what ifs” when considering scenarios. I currently manage a team of analysts focused on process improvement and project implementation. I use those ADHD traits to help me identify risks in projects and spot trends in data.

The things that are detrimental to my work, I find way to manage. I struggle with keeping track of time, paying attention in meetings, and remembering all the things I need to do. Medication helps with some of it. I also find physically writing things down helps me remember better, so I keep a pile of notebooks by my desk and color code them based on the project or person I am talking to. Having a white board where write a “To-Do” list also helps.

I only disclosed my ADHD to my employer when I had to ask for accommodations (in this case it was due to us moving to a smaller office and me losing my private office - I can’t work at a cubicle - and have no space for a private office in my home)

I also make a point to showcase my ADHD as a challenge I’ve over come if I do ever talk about it professionally. This shifts people’s mindsets away from me being a risk or incapable and into me being a strong and disciplined person. I try not to discuss any of my struggles in a way that paints me as sympathy seeking - not because I don’t think I don’t deserve sympathy, but because in a professional setting that tends to be looked down on - especially coming from a woman.

Not saying any of that is right, it’s just how it is - and the only way to change perceptions about ADHD in the professional world is to make it as digestible as possible for those who don’t understand. If we take those baby steps now, hopefully we can build more awareness and understanding and normalize talking about things like ADHD as professionals without worrying about it changing the way we are regarded in our careers.","2

ADHD,Other,an Associate 2,9 months,"I think it’s a valid point to say be careful. Even if you have adhd it’s still possible to use amphetamine-based medication in an unhealthy way, especially if you have a high-pressure job where working longer hours is rewarded. It’s important to keep your sleeping/eating schedule locked down and not take more than you need. Also important to do some either therapy or life/adhd coaching in conjunction and not expect the medication to magically fix all your problems, especially long-term.

TLDR; ADHD medication is a tool, and used responsibly and in the right way can change your life for the better, and used recklessly/without developing healthy habits and systems alongside its use can be destructive, even if you have adhd.","3

I’ve had a lot of mental illness in my family & lots of family members that went on and off all kinds of medication… in my experience, meds may actually help with diagnosed ADHD. Advocate for yourself, get some formal tests done, and try it out. I hope whatever path you choose, you advocate for yourself and take action! If it’s not through meds, keep looking for ways to live your life in a way that accounts for your ADHD. You matter! 👍","4

ADHD,Other,a Community Health Educator 1,9 months,"Just went through it with big kid. It'll be a long process exploring family history, symptoms across multiple domains and their affects.

All total, the interview took probably three hours and then the surveys for me, big kid's partner, and big kid's employer probably took another hour.

Data analysis took a week or two, followup appointment is next week.

Medication will depend on symptoms: mood stabilizers for emotional affect, stimulant based for the executive dysfunction part.

There are many treatments for ADHD, and I think the QEM1 mention is about a specific family of drugs, which are more addictive.

Consider the differences between Adderall and Methylphenidate. The treatments approach the condition in unique ways.

Spoiler - I found that Methylphenidate has been a lot more effective, and a lot LESS addictive than Adderall. YMMV.

In short, I'd encourage you get treatment for the ADHD - the right dosage will keep you creative and engaged, but not scattered when you're trying to achieve your job goals. It saved my professional career, to be honest.

ADHD,Other,an Associate 1,a month,"1.) no disrespect but ADHD is often compounded by social media usage so try to not allow yourself to take breaks or use the apps until you’ve studied x hours.
2.) if you get stuck in a reading and aren’t processing it, skim through until multiple choice. MC is more stimulating and can feel like a more active learning process.

ADHD,Author,an Accountant 1,25d,"I was in the same boat, but in the end passed them all! Some of my strategies included:
- very frequent breaks. I just can't realistically hammer through the material for an hour strait. 15-20 minute sprints seemed to be a sweet spot for me; and I got a little ""treat"" at the end of each sprint (ex: a round of playing Stardew Valley, in which each in game ""day"" is about 10 minutes). In theory this means my study time took longer, but if I compare it to needing to reread things over and over because I never retained it, or scribbling random doodles in bored frustration rather than engaging with the material... it probably evens out.
- I had a public transit based commute, and study materials on my phone. It is much easier to focus on those materials when there's literally nothing better to do while I'm going to or from work. Plus the amount of time is similarly limited.
- Sometimes I did things like make my own acronyms because the ones offered by Becker can kinda... suck. Also talk about the topic to your partner/roommate/friend/pet/houseplant; trying to explain the material will show how much you know and help it stick. In either case, you're re-processing and applying the information, which helps.
- Taking breaks 2.0. If it seems like nothing is sinking in, no matter what you do, put it down for a while. I honestly recommend taking a short nap, even. Turns out that being tired gets in the way, lol.

Hope any of these help!",1,2024-09-17 21:43:02,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/for-those-with-addadhd-how-did-you-study-for-the-cpa-exams-even-with-adderall-my-mind-tends-to-be-elsewhere-and-i-cant-sit-still,1,33,442

To top it off I'm dyslexic and had to go back and double check what I read was correct. I actually ran out of time on both of those exams and had to answer what I could in a hurry. Luckily I prayed hard enough that I passed them both. I wasn't on any ADHD medicine at the time but I'm sure it would have helped. Looking back I probably should have requested the additional time due to my dyslexia but I wanted to take the exam without any special treatment.

ADHD,Author,a Recruiter II 1,8 months,"I can totally relate to this situation. First of all in regards to the issue of not feeling equal to your co-workers due to the fact that you only have a high school diploma- I would not even let that bother you. I have several co-workers that come to meetings and talk a lot but at the same time they don't really understand what's coming out of their mouth LOL. It's kind of like a dog I used to have where she used to bark all the time and was the sweetest thing but at the end of the day she just liked the attention and liked to hear herself I suppose. I have to admit I was a little slower when I first started and when I went to coworkers to try to collaborate and learn. I was unfortunately met with a cold shoulder and a bunch of excuses. In some cases I attempted to have a meeting of the minds to brainstorm and was just met with a dead end road where the other individual would contribute very little and was a total waste of time. Now with this being said I had set out on a quest to not just sharpen my skills but to dominate my competition. As a recruiter I can tell you I run circles around these people now. My operations manager and talent acquisition director are now saying great things about me and my work ethic. My coworkers are now trying to figure out what it is that I'm doing that has caused my workflow/results to increase. I just keep my secret sauce to myself now lol

So don't beat yourself up about not being able to contribute different ideas right away. I can tell you as a previous manager part of our job is to listen to everyone and reply in an extremely positive manner as to not discount anyone's creative solutions. Of course that doesn't mean that they will be implemented or even acted upon. So you see sometimes they may be talking a lot to make them sound more important than they really are 🤣🤣🤣. Just concentrate on honing your craft and letting your results speak for themselves. Just be like me ""silent and deadly "" LOL 👍👍👍. They won't see you coming and they'll never know what hit them LOL",1,2024-09-17 21:43:44,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/ive-been-at-my-job-for-4-months-the-company-culture-is-great-however-i-dont-feel-smart-enough-for-this-role-and-its-causing,1,35,460

ADHD,Other,a Lead Technical Writer 1,8 months,"I'm the opposite, while only having a GED equivalent, the corporate culture where I work was not up to par. The 'say one thing and do quite another' philosophy whilst hiding behind Eastern Philosophy.
I made my metrics and deliverables without issue and worked hand-in-hand with stakeholders to represent them accurately.
Then I noticed that I was being targeted. I tried the respectful conflict resolution route, only to have my day-to-day disrupted by nepotism, tried to apply for a different role internally only to be gaslit by HR with the suggestion that I demote myself.
Long story short, it's easy to give in to the Imposter Syndrome. It's harder to realize that what you do isn't particularly difficult, it just so happens that other people make it difficult with unrelated agendas and egotistical addendum.

Instead of googling not being smart enough, research your ADHD gifts - there are so many. hyperfocus can be willingly activated against anything with 15 - 20 minutes of focused energy. You can literally learn anything in a day.

ADHD,Author,a Director 2,8 months,"It was really good to read this story. I too have a GED. I too have ADHD, recently diagnosed.
About 12 years ago I was new at an organization and killing it because, well it was so easy. In 3 years from near entry level I was a director of the organization, part of a 12 person leadership team of a company of 800 people. I was in that role for 8 years, never before or since has anyone been apart of that team with no higher ed degree. I never felt comfortable in that group, particularly when they started comparing alma maters. the first year I was terrified of making some faux pass or say something stupid out of ignorance. about 6 years later one day I realized I was the veteran of the group and I knew the history behind everything that was going on. I ended up reporting to 7 deputies and at times the CEO. The last one and I clearly did not see eye to eye and I tendered a long resignation ( I also had a parent in a terminal situation and I wanted to spend time with them while I could) he was fired before even my last day but I was done, Now I can't make it past a screener to get an interview to save my life, been unemployed for 12 out of the last 18 months.
Anyone know the PMP certification for project management from PMI, the project management institute? I took all the training, took the practice exam, I was the first one done by a long shot and had the second highest score. I had more qualifying experience to sit for the exam than most in my class, then I found out a degree is a prerequisite. Doesn't specify any particular degree, but no degree no certification.

ADHD,Other,KPMG 2,4 months,"Director's perspective:

1) First, Welcome and congratulations! Consider yourself extremely lucky to land a Big4 as your first job. Now that you're here, you're expected to observe and learn on the job. You should plan to continue learning and growing your skills throughout your career. This is not unique to KPMG but rather standard for all companies. Unfortunately, College/Uni doesn't adequately prepare students for success in the real world.

ADHD,Other,Authora Senior Legal Counsel,3 months,"I've tried implementing some tools and strategies, like:
- Using a task manager (TickTick) to break projects into smaller action items with deadlines
- Scheduling focused deep work blocks and using a time tracker to stay on task
- Proofreading documents on paper and reading aloud to catch errors
- Pausing and taking deep breaths when I feel the urge to respond impulsively to emails

While these have helped some, I clearly still have work to do to meet expectations consistently. It's been a journey to get to this point - I struggled in past roles to make it past the 1 year mark, but finally got an ADHD diagnosis from a psychiatrist which has been eye-opening.

I would really appreciate any tips from this group on additional strategies you've found effective to:
- Ensure alignment with stakeholders on deliverables (e.g. confirming understanding of expectations upfront, asking clarifying questions)
- Improve follow-through and relentless execution on projects (e.g. accountability structures, check-ins with managers)
- Calibrate the right level of depth and detail in your work (e.g. clarifying purpose/audience)
- Manage impulsivity and anxiety in high-pressure moments

I'm sure many of you can relate to the challenges of thriving as a lawyer with ADHD! I'm committed to building the skills and habits to succeed in this career for the long-term.

If I am unsure where something is ahead of time, I check my app before adding it to my list with the aisle number. This seems to help me a lot, but I also have ASD, so it is probably a little bit of that driving the organization. I also go when I know it will be less busy, which seems to help me a lot.

Where I really struggle is meal planning! Both my husband and I have ADHD, so trying to plan out a week's worth of meals is so hard. Because we operate so much on how we feel and what we are in the mood for that it is sometimes impossible to figure out what we want to eat for dinner on Thursday on a Sunday afternoon. lol.

ADHD,Other,a Manager 1,6 months,"I help the nervousness/anxiety about talking to people by imagining interactions and what I might say about them.

if I have a presentation, I make a “script” and have it in front of me but I memorize it and only glance at it.

For social interactions:
1. People expect you to read between the lines about what they Actually mean. So frustrating but if you learn to read their facial expressions, it becomes easier.
2. There are unofficial rules Everywhere. Unfortunately each company is different so I stay quiet until I can figure them out.
3. People don’t like it when you’re overly honest. Think about the level of honesty you’d have with a small child about something and gentle your response to that level. This is extreme but I wouldn’t be blunt with a child but I assume an adult can handle that and that is Incorrect","7

ADHD,Other,Booz Allen Hamilton 1,6 months,Manager 1 is really speaking my language here. I've struggled with these things so much having ADHD. And I can't read social cues anymore because I WFH which I prefer. But that part is hard. I am so overly honest. I litterally am always like why did I say that. It's like I can't control what comes out of my mouth sometimes and I can't read in between the lines of so many things. I'm struggling with it now uhhggg,"2

ADHD,Other,EY 1,6 months,"Hi there! I’m AuDhd and here are some things that help me:
1. Two 30 mins breaks that I have a formal accommodation for.
2. Ways of working meeting with everyone where I not only ask them questions about working with them but I go through best ways to communicate with me.
3. Embrace the pause. These days, people are so quick to reply and often interrupting others. I have found it helpful to say, “That’s interesting. Let me think about it for a minute,” so they know that I am not ignoring what they said and just need a minute to gather my thoughts.
4. Require any agenda for any and every meeting on your calendar. The day before, pull those things together and get your thoughts ready for the next day. This can take me an hour at the end of the day. I have this specifically blocked off on my calendar to dedicate my time.
5. With my direct leadership, I let them know I do not do well in large social settings and get overstimulated easily. They have accommodated my need to limit networking.
6. I also have this issue of speaking quickly which then triggers a stutter. I usually let my direct leadership know to step in when I start stuttering as this is a sign for shutdown for me.
7. I calendar block as much as I can because I get autism inertia and am unable to refocus when my schedule and thought are broken. This is not always possible but helpful when I have parts of my day blocked.

Hope this helps!! Feel free to message for any specific questions.","2

ADHD,Other,a Partner 1,8 months,"Similar experience for me. As a child, my teachers told my mom to get me checked by doctors. I had great grades, but procrastinated and was usually speaking way out of turn. All the time.

I found this denial in treatment out when I was around 20 or so. I'm now 34 and have been diagnosed with ADHD and been taking meds for about 6 months. Adderall isn't the only medication for ADHD. I take bupropion because I'm pregnant and it's safe for pregnant and breastfeeding women. That being said, it's been a huge eye opener for me. Before being treated, I was considering quitting my job, I was struggling with anxiety and frustration issues. I lacked general organization and many other symptoms of ADHD.

Since starting treatment, I've been happier than before, my work performance has soared, I'm more effective at home, and I've gotten better at asking for help in areas that I know are my weaknesses. Try reading a book: Smart but Scattered. My psychiatrist also had me read that in addition to the medication and it was helpful to understand strengths and weaknesses in executive skills.

I feel like I could've had a much more successful time in school and college had I been treated.

ADHD,Other,a Postdoctoral Researcher 1,8 months,"I recently realized that I have ADHD symptoms. I'm in my mid-30s. I went to see a psychiatrist, and she diagnosed me with combined type ADHD. Neither my family nor I didn't know that I had an ADHD. Therefore, I struggled while growing up and couldn't develop my communication skills with people well. Because I was having a hard time listening to people or remembering some things that I could use to answer. Or start a new conversation. I was a very quiet child.

ADHD,Other,a Maintenance Supervisor 1,8 months,"￼ When I was in your shoes, I tried, and I couldn’t do it. I knew that I needed help but the changes and my behavior and thinking interfered with the routines and responsibilities that I had at the time. I was a single parent and working a job that required me to be on-call after hours at times. I was scatterbrained, but I learned to successfully multitask 60% of the time by my 20s. although I hadn’t mastered the technique, it’s how I held things together.

I never wanted medication. I didn’t like the idea of being dependent on a chemical as it made me feel like I was admitting that I wasn’t good enough to Master myself. When I finally agreed to try, it changed my world for the good and bad. I was able to stay focused. I got much further along with projects, plans, and tasks. But during the adjustment phase, I lost my ability to effectively multitask. My routines were still too much to balance because my scatterbrain multitasking self already took on more responsibilities than I could effectively handle. I also never ate nor hydrated healthy, which became worse with the medication. As the plates began to fall and break I decided I couldn’t do it. I didn’t think I would keep my job or take good care of the kids if I couldn’t keep my routine. I was so focused on one service call I forgot to pick the kids up from daycare. ￼

What I know now, that I didn’t know then, was that I needed a support system. I needed time to adjust and some help while adjusting to new routines. The fear of making regrettable mistakes caused twice as much stress and regret after making them. I needed to forgive myself and understand that I’m in a learning phase. I have always been a very private person, so… talking to my employer ahead of time was out of the question. If I had to do it over again, I would reach out to the HR department to inform them and ask for some understanding while I adjust. Nowadays, it’s very common to ask for a reasonable accommodation. I’m no longer afraid of the phrase mental disability or handicap. it would’ve been much better for them to understand that I’m adjusting to a medication then my performance just went to crap.

I have now been on my medication for a couple of years. I’m still learning. I still have a habit of wanting to do more than I’m capable of. But now, I take the extra time to think about whether or not that’s reasonable. Lol. I take it every day for the most part, but there are days when I don’t. In a way, I studied and passed the master exam for a HVAC that I spent 10 years planning, but never finishing. Effectively prioritizing daily is important for me. I learned to be honest with myself, and to respectfully say “No” to myself and others. Some of my friends have changed, which is sad, but it was worth it.

Develop and establish your support system. Identify potential scenarios and create a back up plan. Don’t be ashamed or afraid of asking for help. Although it’s nobody else’s business, don’t hesitate to identify your adjustment challenge to anyone required by law to accommodate you if you need it. Human nature is not always kind and sometimes needs to be reminded Good morale is sometimes legally regulated. Learn your rights and demand them when necessary. Good luck to you and I will keep your situation in my prayers.",1,2024-09-17 21:45:50,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/i-was-diagnosed-with-adhd-as-a-kid-but-my-parents-disagreed-with-medicine-to-treat-it-now-as-an-adult-my-symptoms-are-out-of,1,40,610

ADHD,Other,a Staff Software Engineer 1,10 months,"I've been on that dose for nearly a decade, seeing my doctor every three months, and getting my blood pressure checked at every appointment. My appointments are at different times depending on my calendar, sometimes they're the first thing I do in the morning, sometimes I duck out from work in the middle of the day, etc.

Given the randomish sampling of times of day, and my fairly consistent caffeine use, it strikes me as unlikely that not a single one of those tests would have seen an abnormally high blood pressure if caffeine triggered it.

For heart rate, I wear a Fitbit, spikes would show up in the graph, plus a heart rate spike is pretty noticeable. Vyvanse does slightly raise my resting heart rate, but not enough to concern my doctor(s) given my usual habits.","1

I get bored easily if it’s doesn’t feel like I’m solving a puzzle and will sometimes spend two hours on a quick task that should take 15 mins - and the other way around we’ve found the opposite to be true.

For context - I work at a very small firm with 3 employees and already more or less am living out my dream job, but because we have a small staff - I wear many hats and see that outsourcing some of my “procedural-busy work” increased my capacity to focus on important longer-term projects by 25% and I expect that will only increase as I continue to grow professionally and as a leader.",8,2024-09-17 21:47:12,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/okay-i-have-a-question-do-you-tell-your-employer-you-have-adhd-and-if-you-do-has-it-helped-make-your-job-easier,1,43,667

I am a male at working for a 100% woman-owned and operated (apart from myself) firm and the youngest on my team by nearly 2 decades. it’s been the most collaborative and inclusive work environment I’ve ever been a part of (or observed for that matter). If I were in your position, I would think about the type of company you want to work for and interview with all sorts of companies - more importantly to interview them to see if their goals/values/visions align with yours.

ADHD is actually a benefit if you simply learn to control it.

ADHD,Other,Philips 1,6 months,"Appreciate and respect that experience you’ve had! It’s certainly realistic to be aware of the individual effect meds have on people and their lives. I’m still evaluating how I feel about it too. I’d also say, particular to this professional forum, different careers and work settings may dictate need to conform or focus differently for success. I don’t find an obvious adverse impact to my social skills (tho I do seek feedback). And I also have had feedback that I am very good lately with noticing things others don’t. So this actually may be heightening my pre existing strength. I’ve also been told I’m a little more focused in my communication with others. But this mental health science is still immature… tho evolving. Maybe you had a wrong or incomplete diagnosis and were plied with too many meds that were wrong for you?

ADHD,Other,a President 1,6 months,"P1: Trying to find an “Add friendly career” was the advice I was given, which to me meant finding something that I could have the autonomy to go as fast or slow in my work as needed without the requirement to focus on some schedule other than my own. But this didn’t help the problem- it only served to keep me on meds and feeling different and isolated. The main issue was the social impact of feeling “broken” from such an early age, this caused social anxiety which only makes the focus much more uncontrollable. Taking meds decreased my socialization and increased the feeling of me having a disability, so I never improved until I accepted the meds and diagnosis are the problem, not me.",,2024-09-17 21:47:31,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/i-am-supposed-to-start-strattera-this-week-after-getting-off-wellbutrin-was-making-me-too-relaxed-and-not-wanting-to-do-anything,4,44,706
ADHD,Other,a President 1,6 months,"SMM1: I didn’t mean to imply that list were all stimulants- those were all the failed attempts to treat this with drugs.

Stimulant meds were far more helpful in the short term (Strattera and wellbutrin were both sold to me as a non-stimulants) but ultimately those did nothing and came with side effects. The best by far was adderall, i would always keep a little in my bag as a crutch during short stints where intense focus was needed (mostly for presentations/speeches) but as time went on i found I could leave it home and that’s when i really began to find peace with this.","2

ADHD,Other,a Care Coordinator 1,8 months,"I have ADHD and work from home on the computer at a Healthcare Call Center. Movement is restricted, I'm unable to move around much or take many breaks. What helped me most was finding the right medications. I have several DXs that require medication. Finding the right combination meant quite a bit of clarity for me, mentally, and less mood swings which help with focusing and decision making.

Other things I have picked up are setting reminders in my phone for everything. Especially eating and leaving for important things.

I schedule EVERYTHING in my phone calendar and set multiple reminders on them. 1 hour, 30 mins, 10 mins, on time. Because I tend to ignore the first few reminders so I set multiple.

I did notice someone said not to put anything on paper but I find making lists helps me stay organized. 🤷‍♀️ They schedule my breaks at work so I write them down so I can stay focused. I constantly think about getting up and moving, so having something I can look at quickly on the desk as a reminder: ""I have 40 minutes until my next break. I can do it!"" LOL but that helps me get through the hours at work. Then after work, I have a pretty decent routine with cooking dinner and having me time where I do something creative before bed. I do my cleaning in the mornings before work and on the weekends. And my kids are old enough to have chores so they help a lot with general cleanliness. Which is major. Lol they just started really helping out. But it took a lot of pressure off me just my oldest doing the dishes. I had this thing about dishes... I get executive disfunction pretty badly and feel extremely overwhelmed by chores. Having others in the house helps but also helps motivate me to do my part as well.

I am still learning as well. Working with my psychiatrist and medical practitioners on meds and coping skills while also trying to read up on ADHD. My dad just got me the book Scattered Minds by Gabor Mate. I just started it so idk if it's a good read yet or not lol but yeah hope I helped in some way :)",1,2024-09-17 21:48:08,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/does-anyone-here-have-adhd-i-am-looking-for-tips-to-help-manage-work,1,46,732

ADHD,Other,a Mental Health Specialist 1,8 months,"I have ADD but have known many people with ADHD. Everyone is so different with their own struggles, and I'd say you truly have to find a balance that works best for you as no one knows you like you. It's so important to be mindful of when it's at its worst and best and to just realize how you dealt with it through self-awareness.

As a person with ADD, I've always been hyperaware of my surroundings and can sometimes be overstimulated and start getting a headache. That's something I've learned to deal with in my own little ways, and I haven't taken medication for it since I was 9 yrs old. I've learned to channel that hyperawareness into a great observation tool over the years, and people have sometimes been surprised to learn how I've managed it since high school, but each person needs their own path.

ADHD,Other,a Technical Writer 1,9 months,"""If you have ADHD and perform well in school, it will be difficult to get diagnosed.""

Bingo. That, and your friends, family, and coworkers likely won't understand ""how you could ever have a mental health issue"" when you ""always do an amazing job at everything you touch.""

Well, thanks, but the reason I excel at most things I'm passionate about is because I hyper focus on them for 3-6 months, apply my learning, reach intermediate level by 12-18 months, and then the company doesn't know what to do because they're never prepared for someone to ""climb the ladder"" 🤮 this quickly.

This ultimately leaves me feeling underappreciated, undervalued, and burnt out from spinning my wheels going nowhere fast, at which point I lose any passion I once had and begin looking for an exit.

Invisible illnesses are some of the most frustrating things to live with because the only person who really knows what you're going through is yourself. We've come a long way over the last 30+ years, but still have far more to go if we hope to create an equitable planet for all demographics.","6

Had a somewhat traumatic experience and I went to the doctor thinking I was depressed. My work was suffering. After some discussions, the doctor suspected a combo ADHD and anxiety/depression.

After reading about ADHD, and looking back at my life, it makes a lot of sense.

Now that I know my brain works in a certain way, and that I have weaknesses, I can address them. My life has significantly improved after my diagnosis.

ADHD,Other,a SR. Online Community Manager 1,9 months,"I waited way too long to get diagnosed, and I wish I would have sooner. All you need to do is go to a regular doctor, and they can give you a form. It's usually one page, and it is super easy. My doctor went through all of the options with me on med, and I was able to make the best decision for me. Openly discuss your symptoms with your doctor; they are there to help you.

Don't wait until you are at a point where things start to fall apart.

After going on meds, I am much happier; my mind doesn't race non-stop, my distraction is much better, and my focus and energy have improved. I don't need to hyper-focus to get my tasks done, but I still have the ability if I choose to. The overwhelm and overstimulation is so much better. My follow-through is excellent; I am actually completing things around the house, which I always lacked the energy for after working all day. No one at work even noticed the changes in me. My family did, but not my co-workers just that I was happier and more on top of everything.

As an overachiever, it is okay to take care of yourself. You work hard and deserve to feel better. It doesn't mean that you have failed in any way or can't cope; it is just that our brains are wired a bit differently than the average person.

ADHD,Other,a Director 1,3 months,"Women are often misdiagnosed as having anxiety when, in fact, it’s ADHD. It’s also extremely common co-morbidity in women with ADHD. Obviously this combo and misdiagnosis is not exclusive to women. It can mask ADHD as the anxiety provides enough “external” motivation to override ADHD task paralysis or by keeping the person focused. It’s also extremely psychologically damaging to have anxiety and fear be your motivating force through life.

However, I have also seen anxiety look like ADHD in my spouse. As his anxiety increases he becomes more and more scattered, forgetful, bouncing from task to task, rejection sensitivity skyrockets, and then depression can sneak in and look a lot like task paralysis. All that internal noise of anxiety also makes him check out of real life - he doesn’t hear people talking to him because he’s so focused on his internal monologue.

ADHD,Other,a Director 3,2 months,"Lol there are two sides of this. I'm sure some people are doing it for access to drugs. There are others of us who spent their whole lives compensating for it and managed to make it work until life adds up enough things where it starts to break down. I've fit squarely into the inattentive ADHD classification my whole life, with more impulsivity as a kid but less now in my 30s, but was able to manage it through school becasue frankly acedemics came easy and I didn't need to focus or try. I further compensated in adulthood by keeping my non-work responsibilities to a bare minimum so I could always work when I was hyper focused or able - regardless of when that happened to be. Once I added enough things to my life (house, significant other, dogs/puppy, work, etc.), my old compensation methods became impossible so I had to get officially diagnosed.

For what it's worth I've gone to therapy for it for years and have a strong system in place to add structure and compensate. The meds help but they aren't a cure all. I still need to eat great, exercise, get lots of sleep, etc (all things I've been doing for years) or it's impossible to focus.

Additionally, the psychiatrist I went to disclosed after the fact that they had adhd since they were a kid and could tell pretty much immediately based on how I talked about life, before we even did any of the hours of testing, that I have ADHD. Not everyone presents in the same way and very few people in my life outside of past significant others who I've lived with would have picked up on it.",8,2024-09-17 21:50:39,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/everyone-and-their-mother-has-adult-adhd-now-this-is-a-ploy-to-get-adderall-right,1,51,851

ADHD,Other,an Account Executive 2,a year,"Hey OP,

Coaching plans and PIP’s suck. No doubt about it. Do the things the others told you for sure. But I would seek clarification from them on the consequences tied to the coaching plan so you know where you stand. Have incredibly clear expectations on what steps you need to take and boxes you need to hit to improve. If it feels ambiguous. It is. So if they say for example “needs a larger effort output. “ Ask them what are critical and outlined steps you need to take to show the effort you need to exemplify and what does success look like to them if you increased your effort. Quantify “effort”. Does that help? You want to position it as if you are there to crush this plan and the best way to do that is to have a clear understand of how you can not only improve, but exceed expectations.",5,2024-09-17 21:51:43,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/got-put-on-a-30-day-coaching-plan-at-american-express-amex-is-this-the-same-as-pip-will-i-get-fired-in-30-days-if-things-dont-improve-zsj6-5,1,53,909

ADHD,Author,a Freelance Graphic Designer & Marketing Assistant 1,a year,"The Americans with Disabilities Act includes ADHD as a recognized disability. For an employee who has ADHD, the act can require the employer to provide reasonable accommodations, as long as it doesn’t create undue hardship for the business. If you have disclosed your ADHD in the past and they are unwilling to provide you with reasonable accommodations, you may want to reach out to HR. This can go south quickly, and not in your favor, either way. I would suggest two things: 1) at your one on one, reiterate your need to use Focus to increase your efficiency while also maybe meeting them halfway by adding them to your exceptions list. So everyone else is silenced but their messages come through. 2) Search for a new role, but please please please don’t leave that one until you have something solid lined up. It’s horrible out here looking for jobs. As you can see, by my multiple thoughts in a single sentence, I too am blessed with ADHD. Good luck!

ADHD,Other,a Graphic Designer 1,a year,"Nah I never said report it. ADHD if clinically diagnosed is a protected disability..which means you have the right to request work accomodations for your ADHD. This can mean things like a flexible start time, ability to block out time for focused periods of work etc. Go to the website ask Jan for info on work accomodations and ADHD. They can only say no if it's undue hardship and you still have to be able to do your core functions of your job.

I wouldn't report your boss..if you guys talk about it be reasonable and if you have to bring it up that having small periods of uninterrupted work time pertains to your disability. Take notes and make sure you follow up with her manager via email and say hey just making sure I understood our meeting,and list your points and ask if this is correct. You want a paper trail.

ADHD,Other,an Attorney 2,10 months,"I work with law students, many of whom either have an ADHD diagnosis or are in the process of getting diagnosed. At some point during our work together they mention the importance and positive impact of medication on their ability to work effectively. Often they’re on a combination of ADHD medication and anti-anxiety and/or anti-depressants. The only negative thing I have heard associated with the medication has been in the last year or two and was related to the shortage—students needing to taper and/or time dosages because they otherwise didn’t have access to sufficient dosages.

I review a lot of resources related to having a disability in the legal profession, including ADHD. A lot focus on how to be successful with ADHD, but few discuss taking medication; I don’t think it’s because few people have ADHD and take medication, but because people find it difficult to disclose that they have a disability in our profession, understandably so.

Here are some that discuss their experience with ADHD:

One experienced lawyer talks about what it was like getting diagnosed and treated (with medication) later in life:

ADHD,Other,an Associate 2,10 months,"Stimulant medications are absolutely addictive. Try and keep your dose extremely limited. Anything over 10-20 mg a day is worrisome IMO. The productivity is amazing and will help you, but it will narrow your vision and tunnel focus you. It’s a magic maker for associate work. It is a crutch for attorneys who are trying to level up to partner as it will limit your ability to keep big picture in mind, efficiency (counterintuitive but you will see) speak normally and be relatable with clients, etc. I’ve been through it and experienced practice with and without stimulants over the past 10 years and can hands down say I’m a better lawyer and advisor without.

That is absolutely not the most common experience. If OP decides to try meds, she/he will find out for herself how well they work for him/her, but the idea that they’re addictive to people with ADHD is a myth.

ADHD,Other,an Attorney 4,10 months,"I found out I had ADHD a year into my first job out of law school, but didn’t start on meds for another year. I was terrified of ending up addicted. I remember the first time I forgot to take my meds - I was sitting in my office with the door closed, freaking out and trying not to cry because I was imagining I was having withdrawal symptoms. I wasn’t. I was just experiencing a day without the support meds gave me. I’ve been on them for 15 years now and will say without question they made me a much more competent (and confident) lawyer. And definitely have never experienced any sort of addiction. I go on and off them as needed (e.g. off during vacations, weekends when I don’t need them, etc.)
It may take a bit to find the right stimulant (Ritalin vs Adderall vs Vyvanse etc.) and the right dosage, but once you’re there, you’ll be so much happier and more productive.",6,2024-09-17 21:53:01,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/life-feels-like-its-falling-apart-and-im-finally-getting-a-script-for-adhd-meds-on-monday-i-need-to-hear-some-stories-about,1,56,982

ADHD,Other,an Attorney 5,10 months,"They’re ok. Not the answer I was hoping for. I get dialed in sometimes, but it often becomes a crutch for shitty sleep patterns, as you can start using them as a form of caffeine (in addition to caffeine). I found the biggest benefit to be the diagnosis itself, because it allows you to label what prevents you from functioning and getting things done like others. No meds are able to help you do what needs to be done, and for me they’re just fuel for the journey rather than a sparkplug (that still has to come from within). Also note your heart rate and blood pressure, as both become elevated as a result of the stimulants.",4,2024-09-17 21:53:01,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/life-feels-like-its-falling-apart-and-im-finally-getting-a-script-for-adhd-meds-on-monday-i-need-to-hear-some-stories-about,1,56,985
ADHD,Other,an Attorney 4,10 months,"I will say re: sleep, they tend to be less effective if you’ve had a bad night of sleep to the point where I don’t bother to take them if I haven’t slept well. The meds just have to overcome your fatigue in addition to your adhd and it’s not going to work.
I’ve had stretches where I felt the meds were affecting my ability to get a good night’s sleep. I had one doctor prescribe a low dose of Trazodone, and another prescribe an herbal/natural sleep aid. The herbal/natural sleep aid was much better and definitely helped with no grogginess in the morning.
My biggest problem with not getting a good night’s sleep, though, is myself (so many hours of free time!!!) and my handy-dandy little pocket crack dispenser (aka iPhone).",2,2024-09-17 21:53:01,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/life-feels-like-its-falling-apart-and-im-finally-getting-a-script-for-adhd-meds-on-monday-i-need-to-hear-some-stories-about,1,56,986

ADHD,Author,Authora Consultant,6 months,"I promise you, it's so hard on us parents getting them through elementary and middle school. High school was a bit easier. But, as a young adult, he has been one of my absolute favorite people in the world. And I tell him. It's not easy. But there is an absolutely amazing person waiting on the other side.
Just keep going. And don't believe all the negatives. The best thing I ever did for my son when he was growing up, was praise his character. Find things to praise. Even on the worst days. He'd have a bad day, and I would reassure him that it was a rough day, he had a bad day, he wasn't a bad kid. The amount of tears shed from those simple reassurances will reinforce that your child will have rough days, but they don't define your child.
Good luck! You are seen and heard!","2

ADHD,Author,a Special Counsel 1,6 months,"Thanks for sharing this story - I’ve been wondering what the future looks like for my “difficult to raise” Apsergers/ADHD kid.

My younger son (will be 7 in May) is autistic jusr sees the world very differently than the rest of us in the family (all of us have ADHD, BTW, so not exactly neurotypical ourselves). It often feels like he’s fighting us, as well as his teachers - and it can be hard to just break through his defenses and get him to listen and engage. But I think we just have to both understand him better, and help him navigate the world without hiding who he is. (He’s definitely different - but he’s also really, really cool! I don’t want him to give up and hide himself away when there’s so much he can do!)

It’s awesome to hear that your son has learned to relate his inner awesomeness while still finding his way in the adult world. You must be so, so proud of him! ❤️",1,2024-09-17 21:53:57,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/my-so-was-able-to-get-my-oldest-a-job-interview-in-his-field-mechanical-engineering-its-entry-level-and-my-son-just-finished-his,1,59,1049

ADHD,Other,a Biomedical Equipment Technician 1,6d,"I transitioned from orthopaedic surgeon (5 yrs private practice) to ""knowledgebase producer"" (tech writer) for a personal firewall company startup based on having provided free tech support and PR for them on a private internet news server while I was looking for an entry level job as a Unix system administrator. At that point in my life, I wanted to get completely away from medicine.



I stayed with that company a total of 8 years, switching to Java web development after the first two and continuing with them after they were acquired by a public, international network security company 4 years in. That was followed by 10 years of software development and IT at a multinational medical diagnostic laboratory.



By then I was burned out again, and I got laid off. I spent a year trying out ideas for another career to pursue -- different areas of IT like build and deployment automation; technical writing (computer or medical content or just in general); medical billing coding; medical regulatory affairs; self-employed web site developer; bookkeeper; self-employed handyperson or computer fixit geek or clothing alterations; new career as an electrician or installing solar panels; working for a community garden or something similar; working at Home Depot; focusing on finding and writing applications for grants for my (artist) husband -- nothing clicked.



Just as I was feeling hopeless and trying to resign myself to an early retirement, my father's progressive cognitive losses reached a point where he could no longer live alone. So, Dad moved in with my husband and me, he helped pay household expenses, and I cared for him until the last six months of his life, when I finally had to place him in a care home.



Biomedical equipment technology as a career option crossed my path twice during the 5 years after my layoff. The first time I was still actively job hunting for something in IT. The second time, the 5-month local community college program had tuition discounted to half price and was offering paid internships, and I knew my father wouldn't be around much longer, so I jumped at it. I hired daytime caregivers so I could attend classes full time.

A year later (5 months ago) I was hired at the hospital where I did my biomed internship. I'll complete my 6-month probationary period at the end of this month, and I'm loving it.",5,2024-09-17 21:54:37,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/looking-for-some-advice-i-have-been-working-in-healthcare-as-an-rn-for-over-8-years-during-that-time-i-have-tried-many-different,1,61,1065

ADHD,Author,Authora Recruiting Coordinator Lead,8 months,"Right now I’m looking to step away from coordination and move into a strategy and operations manager role.

The primary accommodation I need is to have the flexibility to work remotely. In an office setting, you have to mask the entire time you’re there, the noise (especially in an open floor plan) is overwhelming and distracting, and I can’t stand being micromanaged. I’ve worked remotely since 2021 and it’s really helped me thrive and be more productive. I can be myself at home, complete my tasks, and only “mask” when I have a meeting.

Honestly I would hire the person with ADHD. Because I’ve been open about my ADHD in my current job, it’s allowed others to also be open. Some of the best direct reports I’ve had have ADHD.

For him it meant working in the medical field, helping the elderly. For me, I'm in insurance but know how to code so I find projects for myself all the time. And I get to help others who aren't so code savvy. Outside of work I learned Python so I make myself little projects there too (portfolio optimization, plotting maps, grocery list maker haha).

Restless.

I try to remind myself that my primary purpose is found outside of work. In my case, with my family, my community, our faith tradition, etc.

Mileage may vary. I just feel the societal narrative is that ""meaning is found in your career,"" and so when you feel a need for more meaning, our go to assumption is that this means we need a new job.

I don't know.

Although the older you get the less encouraging people will be towards those kind of goals. Ie. if you’re 10 and you tell someone you want to be a chef they’ll cheer you on. But once you’re 40 people will just tell you to keep it a hobby.","1

I don’t have any answers, but I just wanted to say that you’re doing great, but you are under no obligation to. If this job is sucking life out of you and your soul is weary, I would really encourage you to take some time off if possible. Can you go on reduced hours even? Is that an option? I think you may be past the point of burnout and that will not help you or the firm. So it’s better to talk to HR now and see if there’s any temporary adjustments like a reduced hours time to avoid burnout or lessen it… or maybe stop billing in the extremes? Not sure but I just hope you’re able to take some pressure off of you and not look to pleasing others as the reason to keep pushing through when your soul and mental health are signaling you for rest. Take care of yourself first. We all need that reminder in this profession. We are not meant to live to work, we work to live. I used to bill a ton and then hit major exhaustion.

ADHD,Other,an Associate 4,8 months,"[Sorry this is long, but I’ve been there, so I may be able to offer some insight.] His gpa is scary low. Is he just struggling with completing his exams in the allotted time (even with the extra hour)? If time is still a huge factor, find out if the portions of the exam that he is able to complete are primarily correct. (i.e. is he slow but accurate?)

Or is there a large comprehension issue / component involved too, where he isn’t finishing his exams and he isn’t accurate even on the portions that he was able to get to. This will require him to review his past exams with his professors.

If it is just time, I know a few students with ADHD who received double time; but a majority of us at my school with accommodations received time and a half. Either double time or time and a half would be more time than just the extra hour he is currently receiving as an accommodation.

If it is time and accuracy; I think you both are right in questioning whether this is the correct field for him.

Also, is he putting forth 100% effort or is he more lax with his studies? I ask this because I gave it everything I had, spending at least 15 hours a day either in class and doing assignments/readings, including at least one full day of the weekend. My first semester I received a 2.46 GPA. I realized after my first year that I was focusing on the wrong things. I spent too much time reading every case (instead of utilizing summaries) and not enough time just memorizing the black letter law from outlines and practicing the application. Once I figured out what I needed to focus my studying on, I did substantially better; making the Dean’s List every semester thereafter. So it is possible.

He needs to have an honest conversation about his performance, his weaknesses, and his study habits to see if change is even possible in his circumstance before he makes his decision. Best of luck to you both!!!!",5,2024-09-17 22:00:54,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/my-fiancee-was-diagnosed-with-adhd-9-months-ago-he-just-got-his-grades-back-for-his-first-semester-of-law-school-his-gpa-is-1,1,68,29

Did he cut exams and just not show up? Leave most questions blank? Just writing random wrong stuff with no case cites will beat that gpa.

ADHD,Other,a Director of Social Media Intelligence & Social Media Communities 1,9 months,"I would never disclose ADHD. It’s an invisible illness and those without it can’t understand it the way they can understand someone in a wheelchair. They’ll just consider you lazy, easily distracted, and forgetful. They’ll think you have an “attention deficit”, which is not at all how ADHD works, it’s more accurately called a preferred task focus. Also, I doubt you have a bad memory. You more likely have “prioritized memory allocation”; you may have forgotten what you had for lunch yesterday but you remember in detail something you read 10 years ago. So-called “ADHD”, is actually a huge asset in the fast paced environment of a corporate setting. While ADHD affects people with a range of cognitive abilities, if you’ve been employable up to this point, you’re likely fairly smart. That, combined with rapid processing and broad data collection common in an ADHD brain, you can likely think quickly on your feet, can connect the dots of disconnected elements, and bring creative thinking to the table.

ADHD,Other,a Property Management 1,6 months,"Please stop blaming “discrimination” for your issues at work. Nothing is to blame outside of yourself. Your employers lives went on without you while you were away, and their needs changed. It’s entirely up to you to catch up and get on board with the program, and adapt to the changes.

Do your take prescription medication for ADHD? Do you do any kind of cognitive behavioral therapy or exercises on your own time to improve your brain health and functioning? I highly recommend that you do the necessary things to get healthier and help yourself improve as quickly as possible.

What kind of FOOD and BEVERAGES are you consuming? Your diet has a LOT to do with your mental functioning. Do you drink caffeinated beverages or energy drinks or sweetened drinks or alcohol? Do you eat sugary or salty snacks or foods containing Soy Oil or High Fructose Corn Syrup? Those things and highly processed non-food “foods” can severely impact your brain’s ability to concentrate or function properly as well as cause a host of other health problems.

Do you take vitamins and eat fresh vegetables and fruits and other healthy natural foods daily? Sometimes nutritional deficiencies can cause mental clarity problems.

Do you exercise for the sake of exercising daily to keep your circulatory system working properly? Do you make sure to get to bed at a reasonable hour and get at least 7 hours of quality SLEEP nightly?

I would recommend you analyze your habits and diet and make some adjustments to eat (and drink) a more natural, plant-based diet, as free of chemicals, salt, sugar or saturated fats as possible, and get plenty of sleep and regular exercise to get your mind and body in better control and balance. There is no “magic pill” to make us healthy. We have to put in the effort to care properly for the delicate machine we walk around in.

I recommend you try small adjustments to your diet and lifestyle first to get your brain and body healthier and in better control.

Also, do you indulge in negative thinking or dwell on negative events from your past, or frequently worry over the future or potential things that haven’t even happened? These bad habits cause you to develop neural pathways or “tracks” in your brain that cause toxic chemicals to excrete and can lead to poor mental and physical health. There are things you can do to stop these bad thinking habits, like telling yourself “STOP! CANCEL!” When you catch yourself thinking something negative and then telling yourself a positive opposite or a different story that’s positive to mentally “switch gears” and get on a better mindset. It takes practice to do that, but it can help a lot.

When you’re confused, overwhelmed, overthinking, or distracted easily, it helps to do the following steps in this order:

- Put away your cellphone or devices several feet away from you if possible. If you HAVE to answer the phone, then wait for a quiet time to do this.

- Drink 8 ounces (coffee cup) of WATER

- Then, sit up straight and put your hands in your lap.

- Squeeze the tips of your ring fingers to your thumbs lightly, but just enough that you can feel a slight pressure

- Close your eyes and gently focus your thought on nothing but your breathing

- Inhale deeply through your nose and hold your breath for a count of 10, then exhale quickly and completely out through your mouth, and repeat that deep breathing exercise 5 times.

- Open your eyes, stand up and give yourself a good stretch. Stretch your arms, neck, back and legs.

If you can’t just get up and stretch where you are, then go to the restroom or a stairwell or step outside and stretch well for a couple minutes, breathing deeply as you stretch.

This short exercise oxygenates your body and brain and calms your central nervous system.

Then, take another look at your work tasks, and prioritize them. What is the most important thing you need to get done? What is due FIRST? Grab a piece of paper if you have one and write it down with a little check box to the left of it. What is the next item due? Write it down with a check box to the left. Third item? Same process. Only put the top 3 items on the paper. More than that is overwhelming.

Do that and push everything else to the side for later. Once each of those 3 items are done, write the time and date it was completed next to it and keep a record of your tasks completed. When the tasks are completed, add 3 more to the written list and repeat the process. Keep writing tasks on your list throughout the work shift. If you can’t complete some, then you know where you left off and can work on them the next day, and you’ll also know what your workload limitations are. Eventually this will become easier and you’ll have a well-regulated system for getting your work done and staying organized.

If there are tasks you don’t know how to do or that confuse you, then be honest and ask for guidance or help. Work with your team to accomplish the mission.

It’s important to admit and accept that you have areas where you need to improve yourself and your skills, and to take your own time when you’re not at work to do your homework and learn how to do those things that will help you function and perform better at work and at life in general, instead of wasting your precious and very limited time scrolling social media or doing other unrelated activities to relax or entertain yourself.

If you have to work to provide for yourself, then it’s best to take the best physical and mental care of yourself first and put everything else second, third, fourth, etc..

Learn how to prepare for the next day each night before you go to bed, keep a calendar and schedule and write in them where you need to go and what you need to get done, set out your clothes and whatever you need for the next day. Then make yourself get up early, do some stretching and breathing exercises, eat a healthy breakfast, prioritize your daily tasks and spend a few minutes imagining a successful day and accomplishing your priorities before you get started.

We all have to make sacrifices of our personal time to improve ourselves and make ourselves more capable and qualified for our work. I hope you can use these tips and be successful in improving your work situation.",13,2024-09-17 22:02:13,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/to-try-to-save-my-job-and-help-stop-the-discriminatory-perpetuation-that-i-am-just-confused-ive-decided-to-self-identify-at,1,71,77
ADHD,Author,Authora Social Media Manager,6 months,"While I appreciate your response, what did you possibly gain from sitting here and typing all that? Perhaps you should take into consideration that you do not know my current circumstances or to the extent that I have tried to modify my own behavior, explore and rely on external resources, the money I've invested into the betterment of myself and my symptoms, and exhaust every avenue of things I can think of changing that are within my control and budget. You also do not know who I work with or any specific circumstance around my experience. This is a prime example of why individuals with invisible disabilities are afraid to speak up because their experiences can be immediately invalidated by those who don't walk in their shoes, disability or not. You are part of the problem. I am a newly diagnosed adult trying to navigate learning how to live with a life altering mental disability that finally explains why things have been harder than they should be my entire life, and I am simply trying to get my life back on track. So I ask you to politely step back, let me reach out for help if I feel like I am being discriminated against. If I am out of line, I can assure you a respectful response taking into consideration a lack of knowledge into my circumstances would have been better received. Instead, your has ultimately invalidated your entire response.","13

My therapist thinks I don’t think I can be my authentic self at work and maybe that’s true, but I don’t want to be perceived by others because ADHD is SO misunderstood by people who don’t have it.",3,2024-09-17 22:02:55,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/should-you-tell-your-manager-you-have-adhd,1,73,96

ADHD,Other,a Business Office Administrator 1,3 months,"There is a website out there.
www.askjan.com

Be careful, it's a rabbit hole type site because it's filled with great information. However, it's got very important and crucial information for people like us and anyone with a disability. The site should also be shared with any company, (at least that's my thoughts) that has a human resources department that needs ""retraining"" in the ADA rules and laws. They even have videos for supervisors to watch to learn how to work with disabled staff. It's a handy website for both sides. Unfortunately I'm someone who has been on both sides of the desk and know firsthand all of the rules and how nasty things can get within the 4 walls of a company.","3

ADHD,Other,an Analyst 1,3 months,"I just think that is optimistic (and maybe I’m being overly cynical on some level). It’s more likely than not that someone within the company, your reporting structure, broader team or even manager will hold this against you. Sure maybe they need to be trained about their unconscious bias, but that doesn’t stop you from suffering the consequences for their misunderstanding of a disability.

I just don’t have that much faith in most people and why should my career trajectory/path suffer because someone doesn’t understand a disability I didn’t choose to have? Similar to how women and minorities feel about educating people about sexism and racism - it’s not our job to educate the masses on ADHD. Maybe I’m also burnt out from trying in other areas of my life…

For further context, I work in an extremely high profile, demanding corporate job in NYC and a female in a heavily male dominated industry. Everyone’s office culture is different so take my opinion with a grain of salt and that perspective in mind.","5

Start by gauging the overall atmosphere at work and your relationship with your manager; if it's generally supportive, disclosing your ADHD might lead to helpful accommodations.

The combination of medication and an ADHD planner I made with google sheets along with counciling from a psychologist who specializes in adult ADHD has been the perfect combination of treatment. I struggle with the same exact things you are. I over complicate my job to perfect it, I end up procrastinating and nothing ends up getting done. With the combination therapy, it has not only helped me in my work and personal life , but I find myself accomplishing more.

ADHD,Other,a Licensed Professional Counselor 1,7 months,"Therapist and ADHD-Certified Clinical Services Provider here. I would stay far away from Wisey. It will be a complete waste of your money. I completely understand your hesitation about taking medication, but the thing is ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder, or a genetic neurological disorder you’re born with and cannot ever get rid of. The mountains of research prove over and over again that medication is the most effective treatment for managing symptoms. It’s just how it is. You can absolutely supplement medication with counseling to help with the myriad of symptoms ADHD comes with, whether psychological or behavioral in nature. I would highly recommend utilizing both.

Onto Wisey. Wisey claims that over 80% of their users get rid of their ADHD in 1 month. It’s literally impossible to get rid of it. You’re born with it and stuck with it. You can learn to manage symptoms but it will never go away. This tells me their customers probably don’t have ADHD at all, but merely are experiencing brief episodes of symptoms. Those with ADHD experience the symptoms always. The severity of symptoms can be reduced, but they don’t just go away. Additionally, the “exercises” they claim can help truthfully will do the opposite. For example, an “exercise” they claim will help with working memory is to have someone hide an item of yours when you’re not looking and have you figure out what is missing. The problem with this is that 1. this does nothing towards addressing working memory. 2. People with ADHD lose their stuff all the time if it’s not put back in the same spot every time because they struggle with object permanence, just like infants.

ADHD is not just a series of quirks that cause minor inconveniences in your life, for many it’s a daily battle just to do the most basic of tasks. It’s really not fun. There’s a reason ADHD is in the same category of disorders as Autism, it’s more than just being inattentive or hyper.

If you’d like to share more of what your experiences are, I’d be more than happy to provide interventions you can use to help with symptoms that will improve things if you stick with them, free of charge as well.",27,2024-09-17 22:04:18,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/anyone-try-wiseys-adhd-plan-for-managing-symptoms-considering-trying-that-in-lieu-of-pills,1,77,175

I started reading and I decided to write too. This to help me build a habit and I would like to stick to my passions but I know it won't be possible because of bills etc. In future and, this makes me wonder if being slower then others at achieving some results, standards, I don't know, is considered as factory defect in our society today.","2

ADHD,Other,a Licensed Professional Counselor 1,7 months,"So, Autism won’t really cause dissociation, that would more likely be a product of ADHD, should you be diagnosed. Next, ADHD is not something that will prevent you from growing and advancing in your career. It can create added challenges, but it alone doesn’t stop you or anyone for that matter. If it was one job that you couldn’t advance with then you’d look for a new employer. If you’re having this trouble with all jobs then you need to do an introspective search and examine your role in the lack of career advancement. Second, if your passions won’t pay the bills then do what you have to do to get the bills paid while you figure out how to make your passions also be profitable and worth your time. Third, life isn’t a race to see who gets there first. It’s a long journey. Some “finish the race” at 22, some at 62. It’s not about being first, it’s about finishing. Additionally, if you’re not achieving the results you’re looking for then you need to assess why that is.","6

I went to tons of experts in ADHD, who again are significantly more knowledgeable on this than you are. Many of those experts were personal friends of my parents and willing to spend a ton of time personally discussing treatments plans and options with me. They all agreed for people with real severe ADHD not mild cases meds are the best approach.

But I have tried other options. I've been on a Keto diet since I was 10 (for ADHD and seizures). I never touch sugar or booze or any illicit substances. I work out for at least 3 hours every day. A side effect of ADHD meds is that they can cause a babies organs to develop on the outside of its body yet ADHD meds are still regularly prescribed to pregnant women as physicians acknowledge that the side effects on mothers with real severe ADHD of not being on them can be worse than the baby growing its internal organs outside its body.",,2024-09-17 22:04:51,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/would-anyone-recommend-getting-on-adhd-medication-pros-and-cons,6,78,191

ADHD,Other,a Director 1,3 months,"I’m in the same boat as A1 here, nearly identical story and feelings. Having my focus aligned like that for the first time in my life made me feel like my IQ jumped 50 points. Math and science made immediate sense in ways I’d never experienced.

It made a tremendous difference for me and I quite literally wouldn’t be in the situation I’m in without taking the meds earlier in my life, but I stopped taking them in college. I felt like two different people on and off of meds. I didn’t like that, so after a while I said I’d forego the benefits of meds to feel more authentically me.

The side effects were also pretty noticeable. 50mg Vyvanse daily had me with constantly clenched teeth, less blood flow to the extremities, dropped 20lbs from appetite loss over a few months, and the crash after they wore off sucked. Tried 70mg Vyvanse for a while and returned the majority of the bottle - really important to dial in your dosage.

In summary, glad I took it when I did but glad I don’t take them anymore. Still got a few in the bedside table but haven’t touched the stuff in nearly a decade.","1

ADHD,Other,a Solutions Architect 1,3 months,"That’s hard to answer. Standardizing across all facets, I’d say no. The objective of ADHD meds is to help you operate at baseline.

Some people might have an advantage, but I think the returns are diminishing if you don’t have ADHD. For the already productive person or the serial procrastinator, it might not help at all.

I couldn't get through more 5 minutes of even watching a tv show or movie unmedicated. I couldn't sit still long enough for a dental exam or dinner unmedicated. I couldn't stay in my desk for longer than a few minutes unmedicated. For people who actually have ADHD the meds were a Godsend without them we would be in jail or institutionalized. If you have real ADHD you can't function without the meds anymore than someone with type I diabetes could without their meds. Forget college and high school I wouldn't have managed to graduate middle school without them.

If you've been totally fine and made it to this industry without them then you probably don't actually need them. Leave the ADHD meds to those with ADHD. And leave Ozempic to those with diabetes.","5

ADHD,Other,a Fashion Retail Associate 1,9 months,"I like sales, same process always different so I can stay engaged. EOD kinda irritates me.. just difficult customer insights I have to jot down to questions that are difficult, but they do engage me enough now not to forget. I also have to clock in 3x and clock out 3x, ADHD has won that before. Last weekend I almost forgot all clock ins. Since I manage myself. It can be alot to remember, so when my mind strays middle of the day I start mulling thru which customer example will be the best. Well, atleast I try at the very least my adhd brain gets a few sub conscious hooks in there so I can remember the unique salsa and customer questions now. Originally it was just blank until I managed to remember from a reminder. Which is likely when I'm doing alot of stuff at once, I do the important tasks like helping a customer pick the right computer off muscle memory.. especially if I get bored, like consistent similar customer needs, adhd is tricky. Best advice I can give to anyone is stay engaged, and busy, let your mind wander ahead into the next task, or predicting customer needs. This way I'm not confusing them and getting ahead of them. I'm in computer sales.

ADHD,Other,an Information Security Architect 1,8 months,"Idk about non stimulants but any time for adderall and such. Even when taking it it’s not something you need to take every day (other than the adhd lol) which is why most bottles may say “as needed”

You can stop taking it any time, unless maybe it’s a substance abuse thing where you should talk to your doctor, with no medication related concerns.","1

ADHD,Other,a Director 1,8 months,"I started Adderall in October and it has done wonders for me. However, I'm not a pill person. And I was not confident that it would actually help me.

But I took my focus seriously (there have been multiple times in the last decade or two that I felt like I was going to lose my job for my lack of ability to focus. And I have worked remote for the majority of that time, so I'm not a pandemic WHMer, I was doing it before it was cool.

The downside is that there's nothing but you to keep you on task.

When I started Adderall in October I also started taking my focus seriously, listing it as a skill I was going to develop in 2024. Honestly, I started in December, halfway through. I created a focus tracker that has allowed me to track my metrics. I wish I had started sooner so I could measure the efficacy of Adderall. But I didn't.

In my follow up with my Doc I told them that the biggest change was my ability to organize increased drastically, mostly because organization requires a certain continuity of focus so you can play puzzles in your head. I forget what pieces I'm working with and then forget that I'm actually in the process of organizing. And then wonder how the hell my phone got into my hand.

Saying all this, I realized that Adderall was just one factor of my focus problems.

In the last 30 days I've increased my ability to focus 13.4%. I started tracking 2 months after I started Adderall and credit Adderall not with my ability to focus over a short work session, but with extending my ability to keep a thought in my head from .5 seconds to several minutes. This ability to hold a thought for a couple minutes has given me the ability to actually make a plan and stick to it.

The focus tracking I've done showed a plethora of different things that were taking my attention / side-tracking me from what I wanted or should be doing.

It was all these other things that were a massive factor in me not being able to stick to the task I wanted to achieve.

So, I'd ask, what are you trying to achieve with Adderall? I ask that because medicine by itself does not solve all problems. Literally like a weight loss pill combined with healthy eating and regular exercise.

Figure out what exactly your goal is from an attention stand-point, and then supplement the Adderall with other actions / foods / behaviors that will also help your attention. Adderall by itself will only take you so far.",5,2024-09-17 22:09:22,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/why-adderall-sometimes-has-an-opposite-or-none-effect-on-me-im-using-the-same-dosage-of-the-adderall-xr-15mg-and-its-good-one,1,87,150

To echo others on this thread, your cycle and your diet really does have an effect on your meds. High fat breakfasts with my meds make me a little edgy, while a high protein breakfast makes my meds feel a little more natural. Orange juice is a no go - i found it significantly affects my meds.

ADHD,Other,a Senior Counsel 1,7 months,"I’ve always thought the very best test for ADHD is to stick you in a room with someone who has it, and see how quickly it takes for you to bond.

Social media didn’t exist this prolifically and anonymously 20 years ago, so sharing of experiences (and relating to them) is still fairly new, but IMO a fairly good indicator.

As for doctors, it’s a crapshoot.

Some doctors think ADHD is essentially fake/over-diagnosed and that only the most severe symptoms count.

Others DNGAF and will give you meds if you ask and say the right magic words.

Some are actually good and test and diagnose.

You never know which it is, so plan for it to be the first type and prepare. You can also ask some questions in advance to try to gauge them. How many patients they’ve treated for it, do they typically see this in high-performing adult professionals, etc.

Personally, I’ve always been a fan of masking for this and playing skeptical and worried. E.g.
1) you always thought ADHD was fake, an excuse for bad parents who neglected their children and that were acting out, or a scam to get special accommodations. Maybe it exists but the symptoms are severe and debilitating, people drop out of high school due to inability to function.

2) You’ve met a few adults (professionals and otherwise) who are diagnosed, and they were talking about their condition (they couldn’t seem to stop…) And they’d tell you certain things they did/thought [insert some examples of egregious non-normal behavior], and you told them that wasn’t abnormal, everyone does that. You were told no, that isn’t normal.

3) You had never thought your thoughts/behavior were abnormal, so it never even occurred to you to ask others if they had certain thoughts or struggled.

4) you’re worried now (don’t oversell it too hard as a spiral), and started asking some non-diagnosed people and their experience is sometimes drastically different. The one non-diagnosed person who wasn’t, was just diagnosed…

5) Now list your symptoms and tell them in story format. Pick some good ones, and peel back the curtain just a little bit on your crazy. Stories about hyperfocus, overstimulation and shutting down, deadline mode, waiting mode, difficulty closing out projects once the hard part is done, forgetfulness of very important items, any weird games you play with yourself to make yourself do something boring, etc.

In preparing to craft the above narrative, use details from ADHD sources and your experiences, but DON’T use specific terms (masking, neurodivergent, executive dysfunction, infodumping, working memory, hyper focus). You want to come across as genuine, not as having googled what to say.",3,2024-09-17 22:10:07,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/im-33-and-ive-become-fairly-confident-that-i-have-adhd-am-masking-i-have-an-evaluation-in-a-month-its-a-1-hour-consultation-4,1,88,166

My test was significantly shorter than 4 hours. There’s no real way to prepare for it. I thought everything was basically testing your conscious-mind level of focus. When I got the results, it turned out I actually had no idea what they were testing for. It was testing very specific cognitive abilities rather than what you’d think of as focus. Things like audio and visual processing.

I was kind of worried I was trying too hard and doing so well that I would not be diagnosed with ADHD. Boy was a wrong. The psychologist told me had one of the biggest gaps between top end functioning and actual performance she had seen in 40 years of doing the test.

The funniest thing that happened was that the last test was to look at 8 little drawings and transcribe them onto a blank sheet of paper.

I then switched to a different psychiatrist who took my concerns seriously and asked if I wanted to get tested. My test involved them strapping a ball on my head that tracked my movements. They then showed a series of shapes on the screen and they gave me a clicker which I was supposed to click if the shapes matched. I want to say the test was like 30 minutes. I think every place tests it slightly different and that some of the more lengthy evaluations are to also rule out other things. I was already diagnosed with several other things (anxiety, depression and panic disorder) and we had a pretty comprehensive discussion about my past and symptoms so I think that may be part of why mine was more streamlined.

I wouldn’t worry about bombing it. They should discuss your symptoms in the consultation portion and I would bring up how you mask it.

The doctor who evaluated me made it clear to me after the fact that she made her diagnosis based on every interaction we had, not just the “evaluation” part where I did computer tests, etc.
I was worried too about “bombing” or but she made me feel comfortable about the fact that most women who feel like they are struggling with it do in fact have adhd.",1,2024-09-17 22:10:07,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/im-33-and-ive-become-fairly-confident-that-i-have-adhd-am-masking-i-have-an-evaluation-in-a-month-its-a-1-hour-consultation-4,1,88,178

I’ve been putting off testing partially because I’ve heard that legitimate testing will also involve the doctor contacting family and/or friends to ask about your behavior as a child.

ADHD,Author,an Associate Attorney 2,6 months,"I was recently diagnosed myself! I hated the testing and don’t feel like it was an actual read of what I feel. For example, I had to look at a set of shapes and guess which one would come next in sequence from another set. It was testing my short memory and focus. However, I could see the shapes and could refer back to check if I was right and was stared at by the psych the whole time and wanted to get it over. It looked like I was focused but I just wanted to get the hell outta there because I was so bored. lol I also found the questionaries to be subjective; my masking wouldn’t allow me to say I was suffering with the symptoms because compared to other people my life wasn’t that bad. Anyways, I found a psych who shared a similar background to me and I found myself much more comfortable opening up which I hadn’t been doing before; she understood why I masked, why I was so good at it, and why I had a hard time letting go of it. No testing done, it was just a conversation.

ADHD,Other,an Associate Creative Director 1,6 months,"I’ve dated someone with untreated ADHD and it has significant impacts on a relationship, ranging from being completely distracted when you’re talking about serious things going on in your life to having to pick up 95% of the housework because they lack organizational skills to having to remind them to do stuff daily like you’re their parent. Those kinds of things really put a strain on relationships and change the dynamic from partner to “parent.” It can be a lot. If someone with ADHD isn’t recognizing those things as issues and working on them, I can see the issue it would be in a partnership.

ADHD,Other,an Accountant 1,10 months,"Just curious, why do you use prescription medicine as the last resort?

As an aside, another option is therapy. If you don’t get relief from medications, some report therapy helps. Not in the traditional “how does it make you feel” sense. It’s more of a coach that helps you build organizational skills.

These skills act as safety nets in a sense.

For example, having a spot to place your keys near your door. So when you get home, keys go in the spot. When you leave, you aren’t frantically looking for keys and can arrive on time.

The “therapist” will work with you to develop these systems based on your life.",1,2024-09-17 22:10:57,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/good-morning-all-i-tried-a-couple-different-non-stimulant-medications-for-adhd-and-they-didnt-really-seem-to-work-it-seemed,1,90,230

ADHD,Other,a Manager 1,10 months,"Some great advice that helped me is to understand that not all stimulants are the same. Even when they contain the same core medicine, the different brands have different formulations that release in different ways and people experience very different effects. Because of this I highly recommend finding the stimulant, brand and dosage/regimen (or combination) that works for you.

ADHD,Other,a Manager 1,7 months,"Your kid would have to bring a weapon, sell drugs, or beat a classmate within an inch of their lives to be expelled.

Sounds like your kid needs an IEP to address his learning needs because it's clear he's beyond his peers and bored with being held back. Add in the typically energy little boys have, and it's no wonder your kid is acting out.

Hopefully being challenged at school and having a healthy output for his energy will allow him to thrive.",2,2024-09-17 22:12:20,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/does-anyone-have-kids-that-have-been-kicked-out-of-school-as-in-expelled-what-did-you-do-backstory-i-have-a-6-years-old-sonin,1,93,281
ADHD,Other,a Manager 2,7 months,"My daughter had similar issues with her last school. She’s extremely bright but was acting up and I would get a call every other day from the school. They made me get all sorts of therapists for her and tests and drove me up the wall with constant complaining because she didn’t fit into the square box they wanted all the students to mold into. I ended up switching her to another school (both were private schools), and she’s flourishing. Sometimes it’s just not the right environment for the kid and you need to find what works for each child.

ADHD,Author,a Data Scientist 2,7 months,"You go through the process you're going through. I was gifted as a kid and we had a lot of kids that were considered troublemakers before they were put into the advanced classes. The route here is usually to get a diagnosis from their therapist and work with the school to get them a IEP. I would also make sure testing is actually delayed for gifted and not just the placement. I was tested in kindergarden but didn't get accomadations until 3rd grade.
ps this is all assuming you've tried to have conversations with him and his teachers to figure out whats going on and why he's acting out. It can be hard with little kids but understanding where they're coming from as much as possible can do leaps and bounds to help you figure out the solution.

None of this sounds like it's at the level of expulsion but you have to make the motions that you're cooperating with the school. Don't fight with them or blame them, but do make productive suggestions. An ADHD (or other) diagnosis can help bc you can show that the professionals recommended x.

ADHD,Other,a Senior Account Supervisor 1,5 months,"Depends on your interests! I’ve found that my needs usually involve work STRUCTURE instead of work CONTENT. What I look for is:

- Clear, short-term, and concrete deliverables
- Consistent team work and social interaction
- Frequent, kind feedback on performance
- Low need to create schedules and/or be responsible for coordinating others

As you can see, a lot of the above revolves around reducing ambiguity and having a ‘support system’ at work. Others may prefer to work completely on their own in order to have complete control of their work. Figure out what works for you and then job search accordingly 😊",11,2024-09-17 22:13:02,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/best-jobs-for-or-adhd,1,95,328

ADHD,Author,Authora Planning and Purchasing Manager,10 months,"Addressing my trauma was essential. Regular therapy helped me eventually cross that finish line but it was my journey into meditation and breath-work that brought new perspectives for me. A great deal of my ADHD symptoms have revolved around object permanence, executive dysfunction, and hyperactive thought patterns. By bringing awareness to these issues during my meditation practices I was able to determine my lack of focus stemmed from my need to put other’s expectations for my life above my own.

This lead me through various stages of spiritual growth, which eventually brought me to accept the concept that life is meant to be enjoyed. By following MY intuition and applying my passions, I was able to not only gain better control over my ADHD symptoms but excel in my career growth. This also allowed me to create a side business that focuses entirely on my strengths and passions.

Acceptance of who you are, the things you have done in your life, and the fact that you are exactly who you are meant to be.

ADHD,Other,Clario 1,a year,"Hello there, fellow later-age diagnosed woman here. I'm a remote worker in a closely-related field to marketing. Here's what keeps me on track in terms of performance:

I take Concerta. It helps my executive functioning so much.
I make frequent use of timers in my project management software (Asana) including arbitrary deadlines for the small tasks I may miss in my communications role
I receive consent to record or transcribe meetings (Mostly on Microsoft Teams) so I don't miss the details of a new project.
I use Pomodoro method (20 minutes on, five minutes away) to mitigate the mental drift
I like to draw on my whiteboard with a mental dump to push away the scattered thought rabbit holes, or doodle during meetings (especially if I am off camera) I find it helps me focus on my tasks more.
Gamify hitting your details or small goals- we ADHD are dopamine hunters, and it's satisfying for me to compete with myself.

ADHD,Other,a Vice President 1,a year,"For a few years, I’ve had the nagging feeling that I may be neurodivergent, and a lot of what I’ve read about ADHD in women rings true to me. I love my job and I’m good at it, but sometimes work seems “harder” for me than those around me, and I’ve become religious about writing everything down, setting calendar reminders, etc.

I’ll take this as my sign to talk to my doctor, but I’m curious about what has been helpful for others - medication, therapy, etc?",2,2024-09-17 22:14:06,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/recently-diagnosed-with-adhd-and-im-in-my-late-forties-after-being-let-go-from-two-jobs-since-covid-for-poor-performance-i,1,97,383

ADHD,Other,a Senior Account Executive 1,a year,"The number one game changer for me was finding the right kind and dose of medication. There was a time when I wasn’t taking my meds (mostly due to the shortage and being unmotivated to find solutions) and my manager (also has adhd) said “take your meds - you have a diagnosis and need them.” When I’m not taking my meds, I feel very bad at my job and that makes me depressed. Taking them on a consistent basis has overall improved my mood.

ADHD,Other,a Senior Vice President 2,a year,"Another SVP in late 30s who was diagnosed with adhd in her 30s. Biggest pieces advice for you 1. If you are a frequent drinker you need to cut it way, way, way, way back as in VERY rarely drink. This made the most pronounced difference for me. 2. Medication works. Sorry, I know people like to try to gaslight people with adhd and tell you that you can fix it naturally but there is a major difference in my ability to SUSTAIN focus on the “right” things and task switch when needed when I am medicated . 3. Ongoing therapy with a competent professional. Late diagnosed adhd comes with a boatload of trauma from years of internalizing your symptoms as some sort of moral failure on your part. 4. Exercise most days of the week. 5. Plenty of sleep 6. Continue to educate yourself about adhd.

ADHD,Other,Accenture 1,8 months,"I’d still be very skeptical of the doctor (do they have an agenda, products to sell, motivations to be publicly on podcasts, etc) and fact-check. The development of adhd is way more complex than dopamine, and the symptoms are beyond not being able to concentrate as easily. If social media is causing an overstimulation/dysregulation of dopamine systems (similar to adhd), that’s temporary and reversible by quitting social media. Everyone is susceptible to distractions like this, but ADHD is severe and isn’t reversible. Seems like maybe you’re misconstruing the “cause” of adhd with social media creating some temporary distractions that can be similar to adhd or worsen existing adhd (not the same thing as causing adhd).","2

ADHD,Other,an Attorney 1,a year,"That shouldn’t be a reason to leave this job if you’re otherwise happy. I relate to this writing off tendency, but it’s a habit you learned and can also unlearn if you’re deliberate about it.

Partners write your time off if they think too much time was spent on a task. The assumption is you’re billing the time you worked, so when you both write off your time, the client is getting a double discount, at your cost.

The only caveat is if this comes up in reviews, or partners said something about you billing too much time for tasks, such that not writing off your own time puts your job security at risk. *If* that’s the case, I’d write time off or consider a non-billable hour job (which may require taking a steep pay cut).

ADHD,Other,an Attorney 3,a year,"I am in the process of unlearning the same habit! It’s going well so far, but I’ll add, that’s in part due to moving to a bigger firm and a slightly different practice area (more below). But it has also helped me to frame it in the same way I view negative self-talk and unreasonable expectations generally. Which is basically, be kinder to yourself! Odds are you are doing roughly the same as your peers, but they just don’t feel guilty about it bc they don’t have a lifetime of negative comments (external and internal) spinning around their heads thanks to going undiagnosed.

As to the practice change, I spent my first few years in insurance defense, and we literally had to be as meticulous as you describe b/c the clients fought us on every. single. .1. The ppl who excel in ID are those who figure out how to bill creatively to get all their time paid. (Not unethically… They’re doing the work, but may have to describe it differently to get past the algorithms the clients use to review bills.) I was never one of those ppl.

I still hate billing and it still hangs over me most days, but it’s much more manageable in my new practice and not as much of an emotional strain. So perhaps that type of change could help you too.

2) ensure I am mental/physically exhausted by the end of the day (puzzles, reading, exercise)

ADHD,Author,Boston Consulting Group 1,2 months,"Yes, my symptoms have progressed over the years. I'm a man so cannot talk about menopause specifically but as I've aged, I've felt even less motivated to do/enjoy things I used to love. This could also be a result of life circumstances in general.

My situation gets better if I'm intentional about taking care of my physical and mental well-being - diet and exercise, sustaining/developing connections with friends and family, avoiding quick dopamine fixes and instead naturally lowering my dopamine baseline.

ADHD,Other,an Associate 1,4 months,"I am semi-unmedicated with ADHD. I maintain a prescription for an extended release medication and keep it for the days/weeks I find it difficult. For example, I find it harder to manage my ADHD when I am semi-busy (easier for me to procrastinate and put off the things that eventually build up and make me feel overwhelmed) than when i am really busy. The adrenaline usually carries me when I am busy and I don't find a lot of need for medication when I am super slow. Through, therapy I have learned a ton of coping mechanisms that work for me where I find I don't need medication very often at all (maybe a few times a year). For example, when I am feeling distracted, I get up from my desk and go get a sparkling water or go chat with someone for 5 mins. When I sit back down I find it's easier for me to get back into working. This helps me to not go on my phone and accidentally spend 30mins scrolling, and then having to pull myself out of it and try to work again. I create lots of short lists, if I am feeling overwhelmed I will do a short task first (even if it is not the most pressing) because it helps me get back into working. I try to not to give myself a lot of time to procrastinate because if I have it i will take it. I work better at the office than i do at home, so i try to limit my time working from home (unless i am very busy) and try to pick consistent days that I work from home. I try to exercise, even if it means a quick walk. I take a short lunch with a friend because it allows me to feel more stimulated and fulfilled during the day etc etc. i have found that coping mechanisms are very different person to person (ie you might be more productive at home etc) but therapy, reflection on what works and practice really helped me figure out what worked for me and I have found that it has worked better than medication (although again not the case for everyone). Having the diagnosis really helped me understand why i did the things I did and helped explain my anxiety.

ADHD,Other,a Vice President 1,11d,"100% relate to everything here and went through the exact same doubts and questions. The below is my own experience incase it resonates and fortifies or helps others to better understand themselves and find self-compassion.

I used to put so much energy into masking it was unreal and I had to make such a mammoth effort to go out and be among people because it took so much energy to interact and I'd find myself looking back and analysing interactions with high cringe and shame for days, months and years.
I actually thought I was a combination of shy, antisocial and introvert but oddly had the inate ability, when required and armoured with a clear goal, to confidently speak to a full room, lead and facilitate workshops for all manner and ages of people, it could even feel good! But approaching one person to introduce myself or hold a conversation with someone I don't know well was always the height of awkwardness, anxiety and nerves. Both my best friend and younger sister told me at different times and for different reasons that I am probably on the autistic spectrum but since I was 13 years old, medical professionals just said ""anxiety"", ""depression"", ""relationship problems""even ""eating disorders""! I never took the medications offered and got by with periods of CBT and self guided learning/reflection.

In my 30s, after a traumatic event and psychiatrist referral, I was diagnosed with ADHD. This had never even on my radar since I had mistakenly thought, like many others, that this was for the physically hyperactive. I had been subjected to a broad range of thorough medical and psychological tests before they arrived at this diagnosis so I put my trust in the professionals and accepted the prescription for Ritalin with a small dose of sceptisim and a greater dose of apprehension. Three days later I CRIED happy and grateful tears when a friend casually asked how I was doing.

In the first two weeks of medication I felt the most intense relief and astonishment at how easy everything suddenly seemed. Suddenly getting out of bed was as simple as deciding to get up! The 50 mental browser tabs of cringey encounters on replay, things I need to do, disastrous things that might happen, great things that would never happen and conversation scenario planning to avoid future cringe all got stopped and reduced to 3 manageable and practical mental tabs.

My best analogy for the impact of medication on me is that I've been playing a multiplayer video game called 'Life' where everyone had their difficulty level set to easy and I just discovered I've been playing all my life on nightmare mode and wondering why I'm so shit compared to the other players. All this time I'd assumed they were facing the same hurdles I was and seemed to manage them just fine with extra bandwidth to spare, whilst I have been working my hardest but struggling to keep up and judging myself. Medication was like a friend came over to play and just changed the game settings I didn't even know existed.

Whilst medication certainly isn't a cure-all, suddenly my feelings about myself are totally different. I now KNOW I work a bit harder than the average person (even if I did procrastinate through a work day, so what?). I know I will spontaneously stay up until 2am on a Friday night to solve a big problem no other employee could or would bother to address and I am proud of myself and my achievements.

I no longer agonise over every possible outcome or awkward interaction. I know I am talking more and seem to have less of a filter since I started medication but it's not because I have less impulse control on medication, it's because I don't care so much anymore if someone doesnt like me (see my self-realisations further below).

If it helps with context, after an initial 3weeks of 20mg Ritalin LA (i.e. Methylphenidate HCl), my daily meds were changed to 2x 20mg Ritalin LA & 2 x25mg Sertraline (aka zoloft). I happily took the initiative to cut out all alcohol and almost all caffeine (I allow myself one cup of mild black tea on challenging work days) to ensure nothing messes with my tolerance. People that know me are shook that I just stopped my 5x daily addiction to strong Yorkshire breakfast tea with heaps of sugar which I had clung to like a life raft for many years.
Nearly six months since the start of medication and honestly, Ritalin is the drug that changed my life. The Sertraline I didn't notice at first but now it seems to make me more tired (not a bad thing at night!), excessively hungry (2am fridge foraging) but more concerningly, light sensitive and prone to migraines. I could honestly leave off the Sertraline but it's supposed to bolster the Ritalin effects so I'm following the Dr's orders. Recently we agreed to try a different ratio of the two drugs next month if adverse symptoms don't improve or worsen. In the meantime Vit D & B12 supplements added to my prescription and some new blood test results to be reviewed.

Some of my recent self-realisations:
1. I have valid opinions and ideas I want to share, they don't have to be flawless to be useful.
2. I am not perfect at all things and no one can expect me to be (even me) but I value the things I am good at and my ""negative"" traits are not shameful.
3. It's up to other people to decide for themselves if they appreciate me and my contributions or not. The ridicule of others is a reflection of their own values and personal growth and I shouldn't burden myself with their journey when I have my own to be getting on with.
4. I can hold space and listen to others. I might misjudge a pause and start to speak when they aren't finished but I can still stop and offer them to continue and if they need advice or perspective, I'll give them the most tailored they could hope for.
5. I might forget someone exists for weeks or months but quality interactions over quantity of interactions is preferable to many people.
6. I ask c.10 times more questions than anyone else at work and probably get on people's nerves often but probably 7/10 they are the right questions that needed to be asked and flawed processes get fixed as a result.
8. If taking a taxi for €20 means I can get where I need to be on time and I can save myself rushing, forgetting keys, and being stressed and annoyed at myself and public transport because I underestimated the time I needed to wake up at or be ready to leave for, it's a price I'll willingly pay and I don't care if anyone else thinks it is a waste of money or ""bougie"". I work very very hard at things that pay me well. I don't need to work hard at the things that don't just to conform.

Fellow ADHDer, if you made it this far, know that there is lots of compassion and supportive energy being sent your way from me and my friend Ritalin 😆",7,2024-09-17 22:17:47,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/need-comm-advice-i-went-from-being-so-good-at-masking-and-being-a-great-listener-would-remember-every-single-detail-about,1,107,559
ADHD,Author,Authora Consultant,10d,"This is incredible. Thank you so much for sharing. Like you said I analyse every outcome and possible interaction too, hopefully I can get past that like you did. Have you had to increase your medication dosages at all because your body was getting used to the current dosage? I’ve only been on medication for ~4 months and take probably a half dose of what I was prescribed for because of this of this fear. I take 10mg adderall probably 3 times a week, one of those days I might take another in the afternoon because I don’t have extended release (my prescription is for 2x daily). I feel like my medication could be working better for me but I definitely feel the calming and task initiation impacts (well depending on my cycle).

I think a core issue for me now is that my biggest workplace advantage is my relationship mgmt abilities. I’m on a team now that I don’t have the fancy credentials for that everyone else does primarily because of my personality and likability. Not to sound arrogant, but I can’t afford to lose that masking trait. I have lost too many years to short term projects I got bored with and jumped around on, and not retaining industry knowledge because I don’t pay attention or forget due in part to adhd.",,2024-09-17 22:17:48,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/need-comm-advice-i-went-from-being-so-good-at-masking-and-being-a-great-listener-would-remember-every-single-detail-about,2,107,560
ADHD,Other,a Vice President 1,10d,"Take your medication as directed! Especially because it isn't slow release. I am not a medical expert at all of course but I suspect the way you are taking it is causing huge spikes and drops in your dopamine and serotonin levels which I think would likely make your reaction on taking it more intense but some of your ADHD symptoms around executive management and anxiety could feel much worse when it wears off.

I recall my first day I had 10mg (prescription filled in afternoon) and I cleaned my apartment and stayed awake very late reading a book. That said I still took my 2x10mg the next and every day and found little tricks to get myself to sleep and eating regularly. Ritalin (I can only speak to that) does have a ""honeymoon"" period and the effectiveness drops off noticeably after 1 week but the idea is to find the dose that still has noticeable benefits after the honeymoon phase. So my 20mg was doubled and I had the sertraline added but I couldn't get my prescription filled on time and had a few days of nothing before the double dose + sertraline. Those couple of days were like my pre-meds days but felt a little harder because I knew the alternative. It would have felt worse if the 2x10mg had still been very effective.

Recently I had to survive a Thursday to Monday without meds due to bad timing on my part and that was truly a write off weekend. I was practically catatonic and barely had the will power to move from bed, nothing achieved but extra sleep. Even getting my ass out on the 15min walk to the pharmacy on Monday was too much to bear and I paid for a delivery service!

So I had my dosage updated and supplemented once and early on because it just wan't an effective dose. My 7 year old nephew (coincidentally diagnosed almost at the same time in another country) takes 10mg Ritalin daily. It is really not expected to be an effective dose for a grown adult and I imagine it is similar for Adderall.

I imagine the way you are taking Adderall is probably making it harder for you to ""settle"" into its effects and your talkativeness on the drug is more noticeable to colleagues because of that and because they still interact with the unmedicated/possibly in withdrawal version of you. That could actually be more problematic as they may actually wonder if you are ""on drugs"" when you have these extreme switches.

Try with 1 daily at regular time and get on to the prescribed amount as soon as you feel comfortable/used to the feeling of it. It may initially feel a bit much for a week and again when you add your 2nd dose which may take a little longer to adjust to but it is the only way to arrive at the right dosage for you. I imagine that you will have your prescription increased after 1-2 months of taking 2x10mg daily because you are an adult with noticeable symptoms still but it's nothing to fear. You'll arrive at a good dose that is ""effective enough"" for you and you will still be great at your job. 😉",,2024-09-17 22:17:48,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/need-comm-advice-i-went-from-being-so-good-at-masking-and-being-a-great-listener-would-remember-every-single-detail-about,3,107,561
ADHD,Other,a Vice President 1,10d,"Take your medication as directed! Especially because it isn't slow release. I am not a medical expert at all of course but I suspect the way you are taking it is causing huge spikes and drops in your dopamine and serotonin levels which I think would likely make your reaction on taking it more intense but some of your ADHD symptoms around executive management and anxiety could feel much worse when it wears off.

I recall my first day I had 10mg (prescription filled in afternoon) and I cleaned my apartment and stayed awake very late reading a book.

ADHD,Other,a Senior Software Engineer 1,6 months,"I was diagnosed late in life (a couple months before I turned 41) and it only happened because my therapist clocked me immediately as neurodivergent. A lot of what I have learned that are common ND traits I learned directly from my therapist, but also ADDitude website and neurodivergent tiktok (that algorithm is so scary accurate, it knew I was ND before I did).

For me it's been so many weird little idiosyncratic things. Like not liking strict structure but rather having guidelines with a lot of open space so I know how far I can go. Or how my brain gets totally preoccupied by having an appt or other scheduled thing to do later in the day so it's impossible for me to get anything done before that because my brain is over here talking about all the things we need to do to make it there on time. The way I relate to things people are going through by sharing a somewhat similar story, not to center myself but to establish a sort of camaraderie. Giving context when receiving criticism in a bid to explain why I did something the way I did and explain my thought process with the unspoken understanding that we will then find where I went wrong according to the person giving the criticism only to be met with being told they didn't ask for my excuses.

It's been all these tiny little things getting piled up for me, rather than the big obvious executive dysfunction type things for me.

ADHD,Author,Author works at Philips,6 months,"Yeah. That sounds really relatable!! Especially the sharing a similar story to show I understand! So many years not knowing why! Nobody ever pegged me tho. Therapist that has known me for many years says I’m smart and successful enough, that nobody noticed. They noticed lots of things like you mentioned…as personality traits (not in a positive light usually). But never ND. I finally saw a depiction on Gray’s Anatomy last year (embarrassing). A doctor. But the way he described his struggling with pulls in so many directions and trying so hard. 💡 “that’s me!” Started researching and it fits almost 100%. got the full day eval. And YEP. I’ve always been able to get by fairly well. But I think the world and work world has evolved so much. So much more input and expectation to take it all in simultaneously…mobile devices and IMs are probably my worst enemy. It got upsetting that I just couldn’t compensate enough anymore. And probably setting too high of an expectation for myself because I’m accustomed to thinking I have to address every input because Im thinking everyone else is. They’re not either. Relationships, I hoped, would get easier if I seemed, to others, to be more like them. But I’m wondering if the meds are making me even less relatable? Just a theory.

ADHD,Author,Finance of America Reverse 1,4 months,"I share your need for meticulous organization to compensate for my tendency to misplace things. When I met my wife I had trouble accepting her less than perfect organization. To keep the peace and her in my life, I eventually learned to do two important things:

1) Explain in detail how ADHD impacts personality, habits, behavior, needs and preferences. Describe the loss, frustration and anxiety caused by forgetfulness and distraction. Share your need to avoid these things to maintain balance and peace. Discuss how you learned to prevent negative outcomes by creating a specific place for everything, which avoids needing to remember where you left things. By adapting in this way you turned a negative into a positive, a weakness into a strength. Helping your partner understand WHY you need excessive organization will increase their willingness to support you in that pursuit.

2) Be willing to take the lead in organizing your household and ask that your partner allow you to do this, especially regarding items used or shared by you. Try to remember that your partner doesn’t experience the same anxiety you do when things aren’t perfectly organized. It isn’t personal when they forget or become lax. Most of all, find ways to make it easier for your partner to adjust to a more neat and tidy life. Emphasize the benefits and try to avoid the condemnation and blame.

Finally, it’s clear from reading your post that you’re someone who seeks and finds solutions. Despite its many challenges, ADHD can actually motivate many advantages for those who are committed to honest introspection and consistent self-improvement.

ADHD,Author,Authora Senior Analyst,4 months,"I can recognize that my anxiety comes from a place of wanting to have control over my environment and I want to try and learn to be OK with some of that anxiety but it's difficult. I feel like the way my brain works is that unless things are perfectly organized it's very difficult for me to recognize when things are out of their home, and when that occurs, my brain won't recognize when I leave some out, and from there the mess just seems to spiral.

This has been especially true since I've had to start going into the office more regularly. My home can be a little bit bit messy and because of that I can't find something as I'm trying to get out the door. I'm rushing around making a mess looking for it. And then I'm out the door and can't clean up. Chaos.

I grow resentful towards my husband if he leaves anything slightly out of order because I feel like he's contributing to this chaos. And because I feel like I'm always cleaning and because I carry this mental load things needing to be perfect.

ADHD,Other,a Customer Service Representative 1,4 months,"As far as getting ready to go out the door do you have a little hub by or on the way to the door where all of the things that you regularly bring out-&-about land? This could be a good system for having him just put those important things in that general area, or even in cutely labelled bins.

Having a landing pad has been crucial for my mental health. And I make a habit of always hooking my keys on my pocket belt and my partners know to always put them back. And that always goes back by the door on my 3-tiered metal basket.

And another question: does your hubby want to put things back, he just doesn't know where they go? Labels could work in that situation.
But if he just doesn't prioritize putting them back where they go, then that's a bit more tricky.","3

ADHD,Other,a Customer Service Representative 1,4 months,"Maybe OCD? I recently seriously questioned and looked into whether I might have some OCD. The main theme behind OCD that I couldn't relate to was: crippling uncertainty. When one has OCD they can potentially never be certain about some things. That can show up in different ways and to various degrees. Some people are constantly questioning whether they did something like lock the door, etc.

Anyways, I thought this was interesting. I am pretty certain that I don't have OCD although sometimes it potentially looks like it. I'm pretty sure that those symptoms are more apart of my ADHD.

Based on my past conversations with professionals and my own research, OCD tendencies can be common in people with adhd. The obsessive need to have my space perfectively organized is a self soothing activity that I use to combat the discomfort I'm experiencing from my chaotic brain.

The best jobs for me have been in areas of personal interest, and with diverse tasks.

Favourite jobs:
- educational assistant
- nursery school teacher
- library assistant
- computer & internet skills teacher for seniors (this was a temporary job through a government grant program when I was in my 20s)
- creative movement (dance) teacher for young children

Good jobs for me:
- family support worker through social services
- support worker/care aide for assisted living clients (I quit due to company politics and their repeated disregard for the individuals they were supposed to serve)

Jobs that sucked the life out of me, so I had to resign:
- retail
- medical office assistant
- admin assistant for an optometrist
- emergency medical responder (low-ranking ems for an underserved rural ambulance). I actually loved the training, but couldn't sleep (was on call for 24 hr shifts), and couldn't get past the mindset that I might make a mistake and cause harm.

ADHD,Other,an Attorney 2,9 months,"What kind of accommodations are you looking for? Whether or not it’s difficult will largely depend on your employer unfortunately. In theory, it should be easy to go to your employer (HR if you have them or manager if not) with a doctors note specifying your restrictions and how that restriction will help you perform your job. Sadly discrimination does still exist, but I do think it’s getting better. And if you are performing well, that’s all a lot of partners care about at the end of the day. The other good thing is, you do not need to disclose your specific disability to your manager. It may help in some situations, but in others (especially mental health) you may want to just ask for the accommodation.

I have a recent accommodation for another health condition (but one that is often stigmatized, not as much as mental health though). My manager does know what my condition is.

ADHD,Other,an Associate Attorney 1,9 months,"The game is rigged. I have Apergers, but I am extremely high functioning. I got DOUBLE TIME on all my exams in college and in law school, SAT and LSAT, MPRE, AND THE BAR EXAM.

I have a stack of paperwork of over 300 pages going back to when I was 4 years old from doctors. It’s not hard at all. It’s a fucking pain in the god damn ass to gather up all the paperwork and organize it in a pretty little bow though. Took me about six months.

…And it was all bullshit. I’m not retarded. I don’t need the extra time , quite the opposite. The game is rigged. I was born with a silver spoon very far up my ass.

All the rich people can afford doctors for their children so they can get diagnosed with bullshit. The rich people get extra time, which is what makes those exams hard in the first place—not enough time. It’s modern day Jim Crowe. People talk about white male privilege and all kinds of garbage. But this is REAL privilege—rich privilege.

The half that pass the bar exam are all the rich people. It has nothing to do with whomever can afford the fancy prep classes, it’s all about the extra time.


Then you get out into the real world. Give an ADA accommodation request letter to your employer and you’re pretty much bullet proof. They can’t ever fire you—less they get sued.

From a relationship standpoint, if it’s genuinely you forgetting, he should be working with you to find a solution to help both of you.",4,2024-09-17 22:27:22,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/not-a-professional-question-but-wondering-if-someone-can-relate-when-my-boyfriend-and-i-argue-i-often-think-he-is-twisting-facts-i,1,122,84

ADHD,Other,an Account Executive 1,a year,I think ADHD is playing a huge role. I’ve acknowledged that my short term memory is shot after burning out my photographic memory that I used to rely on heavily. I think you should sit down and talk with him when you are not angry and write down the things that are important to each of you to understand pet peeves. Refer back to that list to try to maintain peace. I honestly don’t think he’s gaslighting you unless you continue to see the behavior after this. It’s very frustrating for people who don’t have it. They may be understanding the first three times but after that it’s irritating. Find balance and give each other grace and space to learn.,1,2024-09-17 22:27:22,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/not-a-professional-question-but-wondering-if-someone-can-relate-when-my-boyfriend-and-i-argue-i-often-think-he-is-twisting-facts-i,1,122,86
ADHD,Other,"a Director, Growth Marketing 1",a year,"I’m extremely forgetful and consistency is obviously not my strong suit, it drives my husband insane and from time to time he breaks down and we have an argument about it. However, this is maybe a twice a year thing even though it does bother him year round. He does his best to be understanding and remember all the good things about me and he just repeats to himself that it is who I am and he loves me and needs to accept my flaws with my virtues. He also reminds himself of all of his own flaws that I have to deal with, that helps him put things into perspective.

Find the 1-3 things you want to focus on during your leave.

Some ideas…

1. structured rest and physical activity. So having good sleep hygiene, daily or weekly physical activity like swimming or dancing classes or boxing (class pass is a great option)

2. Having healthy food with doctor recommended vitamins for boosting mood. I use ashwagandha and mushroom coffee for my adhd.

3.Weekly life/career coaching. Check out mission collaborative and 80000hours.org

4. Weekly or regular your doctor appointments (physical and mental health) appointments. I had weekly support groups with other women with similar experiences and PTSD and weekly one on one therapy along with biweekly visits to my psych for meds.

ADHD,Other,Slalom Consulting 1,8 months,"I recently found a way to tidy my space and it’s been a huge relief. I didn’t do it the traditional way. I had so much clutter that most of the time I was just moving one pile of clutter to another where I could find space to get to what I needed or try to find something.

I wasn’t doing anything with the clutter and couldn’t find the time to sort through it. I was overwhelmed. So, I bought 3 of those large plastic storage bins and just packed the clutter in those. The idea of going through one of these at time is less overwhelming and I feel good about my space. Worse case is that the clutter is sitting packed up rather scatter through my space, a win.

The best advice I can give is to structure your space functionally, accommodate how you actual live rather than I you think you are expected to live.

Sometimes working earlier than usual helps to minimize distractions and setting my phone on ‘work mode’ and I put my Teams on Do not disturb or on a call modes, and tell my team that I’m working in something and probably won’t answer right away (to lower the expectation of answering fast).

ADHD,Other,a Consultant 1,3 months,"There's a big rabbit hole for this stuff, and I think not much is FDA approved, which in many cases is probably because it's not profitable to fund the approval process, but does mean that there's not as good of data as some people would want.

Along those lines, you should be cautious about taking the word of some online rando. I learned most my stuff from Reddit forums like r/nootropics. Since they're all online randos, I followed the convos to understand the consensus on things, and then tried out the substances in small amounts at a time. That way I could safely-ish verify the things I was reading. I believe that Piracetam and most of the racetams have been deemed quite safe, by medical researchers, but you should double check these things for yourself.

If you want a direction to start off in, try the racetam family. Start with Piracetam, and then branch out to a few others like aniracetam, pramiracetam, phenylpiracetam. Huperzine A is worth a shot. For wakefuless more than focus, there is (ar)modafinil. And the list goes on. To discover more, you can simply browse around on Nootropics Depot for stuff that interests you. Before buying, read more about it elsewhere. The Reddit forums are a good place to start, and they often lead you to the relevant medical studies, etc.

I think part of the mechanism of action of some of these is to speed up the brain's usage of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, so it is often beneficial to pair with a choline supplement.

Some of these chemicals are quite potent and require a scale to measure doses. A lot of people have gotten way more into the weeds about it than I have, and also I haven't kept up with any recent developments.
It's certainly a course with potential, but here's some advice you'll often see on forums about noots and biohacking: First make sure your other health stuff is taken care of as well as you can manage it: diet (vitamins), exercise, SLEEP, etc. Then you can start bringing in other stuff.

If you are currently taking any other medication, or have particular health issues, you should proceed with more caution.","1

ADHD,Other,a Consultant 1,3 months,"Oh, also quite worth considering are various cannabinoids, like CBG. This and others like CBD do not have the intoxicating effects of the primary cannabinoids, but can still have some very useful effects. CBD has a well-known anxiolytic effect, as do botanicals like kava and kratom. For some people (like myself), anxiety is at the core of procrastination, and so it can be helpful to have levers to pull to modulate the anxiety too.

In fact, even some of the cannabinoids that many people find intoxicating can actually be helpful for certain people in managing their ADHD, autism, etc.

I myself have found a lot of value with these. But it is a road that probably most medical professionals would not advise you to go down, or at least they won't the solutions that medical professionals offer for your problems.","1

By increasing my education, its allowed me to stop masking certain behaviours (freeing up bandwidth and energy) but also be significantly kinder to myself about my flaws, which has improved my overall MH.

Making key people aware (like my manager and some internal support groups) I have a better network of people to ask for help, which I've always struggled with. A good manager really makes the difference for me - it feels like a safe space where I'm not judged for needing different help.

You could look into an accommodation to be able to take notes on your laptop. Go through HR for that and DO NOT volunteer any information they don’t specifically ask for, especially not to your boss. YMMV since some bosses are biased here and think everyone needs to operate the same way. Sounds like yours is.

The other is to try a different note-taking method. The Cornell note-taking method worked really well for me in college, well before my diagnosis. You basically split the page in half vertically, take your notes on the right side. Then afterwards, you review your notes and write little headers and identifiers on the left side.

ADHD,Other,a Customer Service Representative 1,4 months,"I have to have my anxiety in check with meds before I add any ADHD medication into the mix. If you decide to try meds, which I would highly recommend giving a shot (coming from someone who's life was probably set back at least 15 years because of being hesitant about taking meds).

If you decide to try, just try the absolute smallest dose available of an ADHD medication. Sometimes they will try to talk you out of the smallest dose. Don't let them! I guess they have their reasons, but I have just found it a waste of time and mental health to try to cope with doses that start off too high.

Start slow and listen to your body & mind. Keep a journal of your thoughts and how they change. And finding a way to measure whether you're more or less effective at what matters.

I have found that when starting new meds I can often second/triple guess my behavior, sometimes losing sight of who I am now and who I was before. So I find that I can get grounded through creating reference points throughout my medicated and unmedicated experiences so I can keep them in perspective. Some meds make me feel unlike myself, and those are the meds I decide not to continue. However, I think some of those side-effects were from taking too strong of a dose too soon.

Anyways, my point is trying meds is the only way to figure out if they are for you. Plus stimulants go through your system relatively fast and don't have the same kind of withdrawal you can have from other meds that take time to lower/increase the dose. Try the meds a couple days on your weekend because sometimes it can take a few days/weeks to acclimate. Maybe just take the meds on the weekends at first? Just spitballing here. Also taking magnesium when you take your meds might help. I've heard that in an ADHD audiobook about natural remedies. That magnesium can help curb some of the side effects. And I absolutely have found that to be true.",1,2024-09-17 22:30:23,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/wanted-to-start-medication-to-manage-my-adhd-but-i-also-struggle-with-anxiety-and-depression-and-take-prozac-for-it-my-psych,1,130,223
ADHD,Other,a Vice President 1,4 months,"From my understanding, it’s about 50/50 people who respond better to therapy vs meds. ADHD coaching is usually provided by a therapist that is trained on ADHD.

ADHD is often combined with anxiety is depression. Some doctors seem to prefer to try treating ADHD first, as stimulants are quicker to see if it alleviates symptoms. Whereas some meds for anxiety / depression might take a few weeks or months to start working.

I think it is fair to say adhd meds may impact your mood. But I also think it’s worth exploring if it’s helpful. You can always ask these questions with your doctor.",1,2024-09-17 22:30:23,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/wanted-to-start-medication-to-manage-my-adhd-but-i-also-struggle-with-anxiety-and-depression-and-take-prozac-for-it-my-psych,1,130,224
ADHD,Other,an Associate 1,4 months,"There are plenty of things you can try before meds and yes, coaching can help. The thing with ADHD is that we’re all different, especially if you have other things mixing in with it like depression and anxiety. I deal with these 3, so does my son… but even then as individuals it’s still different. I’m in my mid 40s and off all meds and functioning well with things I’ve learned over the years. My teen only takes meds for ADHD. He was diagnosed at 4 and didn’t take meds until 8. We ruled all other things out.

Not sure who diagnosed you, but sharing this info for anyone reading. A regular MD should not be the end all be all for a neurological disorder, too many things have the same symptoms and symptoms can overlap. They may suspect it, but in a firm believer that a neurological diagnosis should come from as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or a neurologist as it’s their speciality. ADHD is over-diagnosed, under-diagnosed, and misdiagnosed depending on where people are located. There was occupational therapist work done, then improved, there were major dietary changes that improved symptoms significantly (removing gluten… and strict about it because it’s not just not eating bread or pasta, it’s in sauces and spice mixes, etc). We tried a number of things and everything helped, some more than others. Diet was definitely the biggest.

I managed my anxiety and depression from therapy when I was younger to self help books when I was older and changed the way I think o more positive (first one was the secret). My son recently went thru a round of therapy that worked on positive thinking and positive self image for sports, but can be applied to school and outside of school and it’s helped him.

We still have certain feelings sometimes and we work thru those. I’m not saying anyone needs to do all this, just that we’re all different and there are things that do help some people besides meds or besides just meds. My son is only on a med for ADHD and that’s for school and driving.

I also agree you should start lowest dose possible. I have heard from many sources of someone just throws you on something because you’re an adult and have a certain weight, that’s not how it goes. Meds helped when I needed them in school, I don’t need them now. I agree they can be life changing, but there’s other stuff that may help as well. A pill is not a fix all, it only helps as well. There’s days that my kid still has a struggle with a symptom or two because they are not a magic fix. 😇",1,2024-09-17 22:30:23,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/wanted-to-start-medication-to-manage-my-adhd-but-i-also-struggle-with-anxiety-and-depression-and-take-prozac-for-it-my-psych,1,130,225

ADHD,Other,a Solo Practitioner 1,9 months,"I hear where you are, and I know how hard it is.

For me, TO DO lists help -- and I absolutely could not survive without Google Calendar.

Big projects are really hard for me, and my best strategy to date has been setting aside an hour or two to dig in and then stop that project when I start to drift. I'll take a break and then dig into a different project. Along the way, I take screen shots of online research and make notes in a dedicated Word file (for that project). The screenshots and super-editable notes in my Dropbox allow me to stop research without losing progress and to preserve my ideas and research along the way. So long as I get started early enough, this works for me.

In other words, I try to take advantage of my natural skills: (1) picking a topic and diving in -- and down multiple rabbit holes -- and (2) need to jump from project to project.

Again, this is the best solution I have found so far.

Actually, regarding medicine: I know that it is what helps keep me in the game.
Years ago, I tried switching medicine (from Ritalin to Adderall), and the results were disastrous. A good friend of mine went through the same thing in reverse -- Adderall worked well for her while Ritalin was awful.

All this is to say: there might be medicine that would be great for you. If I had tried Adderall first, I doubt I would have been willing to try another need -- but it is possible that someone would work for you.

Take care, and please know that you're not alone.

ADHD,Other,Precision Countertops 1,9 months,I do what I call splitting focus. I work from home so there is no one to help me stay focused. I have found that having some kind of spoken word (not music but podcasts or TV shows ) in an ear bud on one year and a pad to doodle on next to my computer or a fidget of some kind and using it when I start to feel my mind wonder keeps me focused. I listen to the spoken word all day so it tricks my brain into thinking there is someone there and works like body doubling.

Another doctor could still diagnose you fine but when the rubber meets the road, it won't be identified as a real disability.

So if your goal is simply to get medication, then any psych or doctor could probably be serviceable.

But if you do have ADHD and it has a huge impact on your quality of life and ability to do things in life, and want help, then you need the real thing.

ADHD,Other,a Program Manager II 1,5 months,"Not that I’m saying to pay more money - but be wary of places doing like a quick 1 hr assessment and saying you have adhd. We all have challenges. I say this after going through 2 diagnosis during the pandemic and finally got on meds which was immensely helpful. The overly detailed testing was too much (I did it second time for the meds), but I am hearing there’s places doing like easy online assessments.

ADHD,Other,an Executive Creative Director 1,9 months,"I was diagnosed when I was around 30. When I was a kid in the late 80s, I don’t think we knew much about it. I was just a kid who had too much energy, was often disruptive and found school very boring, despite being smart and doing fairly well. Started seeing a shrink at around 30, I got diagnosed and was given medicine and for me, it was extremely helpful. My career honestly started blowing up almost immediately. I’ve also become a better partner and friend. I just feel calmer overall.

And regarding my record, I have no idea. Is that a record anyone keeps? I’m a writer and creative director in advertising so I’d assume they’d object more if I didn’t have ADHD. As for oyster shuckers, imagine how many more you could shuck if your brain felt a little more calm","1

I have always felt that I have ADD or something but was worried 1- the side effect of meds 2- any record that may need to be shared with my employer (although I'm aware of HIPAA).
I've checked with my PCP, filled out a questionnaire but never heard from them again.

I always struggled with concentrating and not having my brain hopping from one task to another to another to another.... I also feel I can finish so much at work as I struggle with sitting still for even a brief moment.

I agree, shucking oysters would be a breeze with correct medical support lol

Everyone is different and I’m not saying I get how you feel, because I don’t, only you do. However, I was in a situation that sounds very similar to yours.

As long as you have your patho and pharm down to the t, you’ll thrive. Especially if you hyperfixate like I do.",9,2024-09-17 22:34:36,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/ive-been-working-night-shift-in-a-neurostroke-med-surge-unit-it-has-been-very-difficult-for-me-because-of-my-adhd-not-being,1,140,403
ADHD,Other,dead Link 1,7 months,"It must feel extra challenging w the language barrier. It feels challenging as a new grad for all, and certain units/coworkers/managers (or a majority) may feel overwhelming. And bullying is real. It happens to the best of the neurodivergent more so if I had to guess because I’m 100% socially awkward esp if unmedicated. The social skills I’ve been able to notice & practice in the past 2 yrs while on stimulants have been very insightful. As well as insights into my thoughts processes, language processing & possible scrambling (bilingual is hard too!) of words and numbers.

ADHD makes me have big feelings and they feel very real to me (& threatening/harmful if unchecked anxiety or negative/challenging work culture exists). Problem w healthcare is that often ppl are having a very bad day (patients sick, families distraught) and staff as we know are pushed to the max of human capabilities for physical, knowledge & emotional capacities. It often feels unsustainable to those w big/real emotions. And RSD (rejection sensitivity dysphoria) which many neurodivergent people have and I had to learn about online (attitude.com) is difficult to manage and cope with other people’s big emotions (and a frequent lack of boundaries in healthcare settings.

Another possible concern is that language details are very challenging in nursing across cultures. Lots of patients are mumbling, hard of hearing, confused, altered, and sometimes aggressive/combative. I’ve tried doing my nurse job as a dyslexic bilingual English (native) & Spanish speaker and have had truly challenging times understanding the drink, confused, withdrawing, TBI, and stroke patients even in English. Then I try in Spanish and call the translator and then try to learn from that. I can only imaging that the picture pages of the NIHSS (if you use them) are quite challenging to rate at times.

I think you will find something that you’re looking for. It may take some looking. I never though I would enjoy the units of nursing I floated to and learned to enjoy like the in pt psych units and detox units that are in patient. Also CV units (not ICU but cath lab predominately, pulling sheaths) can be a great match. Or oncology if it’s a good match. Neurotrauma can be a crazy unit and 6:1 is hard. 7 is worse - should be illegal. But 4-5 is ideal. See if any hospitals around keep ratios on certain units for safety. ICU is intriguing for that reason but ended up being too overwhelming for me bc I couldn’t keep up w juggling & shifting priorities through unexpected emergencies. And it lead to less than great choices and they asked me to leave and work on the stepdown or progressive care unit instead. O did that too and enjoyed the work but continued to struggle w time management and got written up for asking ?s during handoff and interrupting the nurse who was leaving. The culture did not fit and far too many cliques and bullies that I could not easily mix with socially.

I opted to leave rather than watch them try to get me to leave w corrective action plan. I found a new job win the hospital system and left to try another field. I failed at some. I liked others.

I tried pediatric nursing (home health) and learned that I was very good at it. And suited for it as most of the kids have developmental if not neurodivergent issues. Which explains why I could connect w and communicate w the kid clients by singing or playing. The challenge is being consistent & structured along w a 24 /7 hr team (ideally) if routine rotating staff who are tying to follow mom & dads behavior management style and requests.

Later back to hospital for the extra $$ on the paychecks. HH RN pays worse than lost (funded by Medicaid). Often willing to train new grads into the field tho and low stress job w 1:1 client at their home/school. Got to go to a whole year of an awesome family’s gatherings and feel so lucky to have joined that family for a little bit.

Worked as a float pool RN for a few years (could be harder to do as a newer grad? But easier w time). It’s my favorite bc you never get too enmeshed into a units culture. I imagine travel nurses enjoy the same thing. Have to have a wide variety of skills and an open mind to learning & growing.",2,2024-09-17 22:34:36,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/ive-been-working-night-shift-in-a-neurostroke-med-surge-unit-it-has-been-very-difficult-for-me-because-of-my-adhd-not-being,1,140,404

ADHD,Other,a Director 1,3 months,"I don’t know of a blogger but maybe this will help: Managing ADHD symptoms can be influenced by maintaining stable blood sugar levels. Here are some snacks and meals that help keep blood sugar stable:

### Snacks:
1. **Nuts and Seeds**: Almonds, walnuts, chia seeds, and flaxseeds are rich in protein and healthy fats.
2. **Greek Yogurt with Berries**: High in protein and fiber, berries add a natural sweetness without spiking blood sugar.
3. **Vegetable Sticks with Hummus**: Carrots, celery, and bell peppers with hummus provide fiber and protein.
4. **Apple Slices with Peanut Butter**: Combines fiber from the apple and protein from the peanut butter.
5. **Cheese and Whole Grain Crackers**: Offers a balance of protein, fat, and complex carbohydrates.
6. **Boiled Eggs**: High in protein and easy to prepare.

### Meals:
1. **Grilled Chicken Salad**: Includes lean protein, mixed greens, and a variety of colorful vegetables, dressed with olive oil and vinegar.
2. **Quinoa and Vegetable Stir-Fry**: Quinoa is a complete protein and vegetables add fiber and nutrients.
3. **Salmon with Roasted Vegetables**: Salmon provides omega-3 fatty acids, and roasted vegetables are a source of fiber and vitamins.
4. **Lentil Soup**: Lentils are high in protein and fiber, helping to stabilize blood sugar.
5. **Turkey and Avocado Wrap**: Use whole-grain tortillas, lean turkey, and avocado for healthy fats.
6. **Tofu and Veggie Stir-Fry**: Tofu is a great plant-based protein, and mixed vegetables add fiber and nutrients.

### General Tips:
- **Choose Complex Carbohydrates**: Whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes are digested more slowly and help maintain stable blood sugar levels.
- **Include Protein and Healthy Fats**: Protein and fat slow the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream.
- **Avoid Sugary and Processed Foods**: These can cause rapid spikes and drops in blood sugar.

By incorporating these snacks and meals into your diet, you can help maintain stable blood sugar levels, which may aid in managing ADHD symptoms.",7,2024-09-17 22:35:16,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/anyone-have-lunches-they-like-or-an-adhd-food-blogger-they-recommend-i-have-a-hard-time-justifying-buying-lunch-at-work-when,1,142,427

ADHD,Other,Bank of New Zealand 1,3 months,"Or perhaps try drinking consommé soups, so it feels more like drinking than eating? It's easy to make your own bone broth - super-nutritious, and really good for your gut, which translates to helpful brain chemistry.

When you make an evening meal, pop the meat and vegetable trimmings - any clean scraps - into water to boil in a small saucepan. Add a little salt and pepper. Especially include any skin and bones from your meat. Cook for around 20 minutes - by the time you've finished eating your meal, it should be ready. Strain out the solid bits and... it's done.

During the work day, if you have trouble motivating yourself to head to the office kitchen to heat up a serving, bring it to work already hot, in an insulated flask. Pour out cupfuls at a time, at your desk as you work, to drink as if it was water or coffee, or so on.

ADHD,Other,a Director 1,a year,"Packing is a HUGE stressor. You did such a smart thing in packing a bag in advance. You probably figured it out by now, but something that helps me:
1. Have a person who can go through the process with you. Could be someone you call before, at a few check ins, and at the end. I think it’s called body doubling. It helps me limit time blindness, distractions, and deciding on what to take.
2. I write a chart with each day across the top and AM, PM on the side. That way I only bring what I need (I mean, I try lol)
3. I use those packing zipper bags. They’ve really helped me feel more organized in packing and keeps my bag neat while I’m away.

When things go missing, which they do, I freak out too. Instead, I’d like to remember that if I walk out of the room, take a deep breath, even meditate for a minute, go do something else, and expect that everything I need will be there, then I’m much more likely to find it. OR know that I am resourceful enough to find another solution.

I found my zipper bags when I returned from my last trip. Now I am even more aware of having a place for them. I’m sure your backpack will be there when you get back.

I set auto reminders on his phone and do things like put his flossers in a clear container in his bathroom so they aren’t “out of sight, out of mind”.

Now for my scary thoughts… getting off of my meds to successfully carry a child and then staying off of them for 6 months breast feeding.

My plan is to prove myself at work and then consider a baby. I’ve been here a year already so hopefully one more year.

Managing work while taking care of my stepson while my husband leaves for months at a time for military training is rough BUT honestly I’ve found that PwC has been very flexible.

ADHD,Other,a Manager 1,a year,"Yup. Schedules are critical for me and maintaining my sanity. I also think that sticking with a schedule brings a sense of stability that kids need. My kid is in middle school. He knows I have adhd and that I take medication daily. He also understands what my strengths and weaknesses are. I don't look to him to pick up the slack and/or help keep me organized so I don't lose things, but he knows what things are hard for me and he knows I have moments when I'm hard on myself because of it. It has been important to me to be open with him and my challenges, so he knows that those moments when I'm struggling and get huffy aren't about him. I make a point of telling him in the moment so he doesn't internalize my frustrations. It's something we talk about almost daily. It's not a big deal unless you make it one. I would never not have kids because of my adhd.

Crippling anxiety at the thought of stopping meds while pregnant and then even more anxious thinking about life with a baby and juggling work. My OB ultimately said it could do more harm than good to stop cold turkey so I remained on low dose throughout my pregnancy, healthy 8 lb baby. No judgement please, it’s what was best for me and in turn baby. After I stopped breastfeeding which didn’t last long despite trying, I ramped my meds back up to normal dose. Some days are harder than others, but with my meds, endless outlook calendar reminders (literally for everything), and help with domestic type things (maid, occasional food delivery, etc) it’s for sure manageable and so worth it.",1,2024-09-17 22:35:59,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/anybody-with-kids-with-adhd-in-this-bowl-can-you-provide-words-of-encouragement-or-wisdomdesperately-want-to-start-a-family,1,144,464

ADHD,Other,a Director 1,a year,"My kids are 15 amd 12. Both have *extreme* forms of ADHD that manifest differently. My oldest's doctor once wrote a letter to the school system with words something like ""In my 20 years in medicine, 12 of which at this practice and eight at children's hospital, he is the most extreme case of ADHD I have come across....""

Seeing those words the first time was a relief, knowing that neither my partner nor i were crazy, but... seeing those words... this is it... this is / was what hard looks like. I think my second caught wind of that letter and thought the toddler equivalent of ""hold my beer""... because... wow the first was so easy comparatively- once we established services.

Your kids will not be easy, but they will help you better understand yourself, this disability, and how to advocate for it. We've been through bullies, low growth, behavioral challenges, chores, medication shortages for everyone, and so forth. And the pandemic? Wow, that was tough on them in every sense. We have helped get their education back on track, because it hit for each of them at major social and emotional milestones.

It has made me slow my career asperations, and my wife gave up her business to get them back on track during the pandemic. But yeah, I've been back at full travel for the past two years. I can't stress enough how important making them whole has been both of our focuses - career be damned. (Also, my boss leverages me for the hard stuff, so he's mostly in my corner when I need something.)

In all likelihood, if your and your partner have ADHD, your kids will have a form of it too. The expenses of replacing stuff, various medical appointments, and extra organizational things still allow us live well comparative to many, but my direct peers / colleagues and I live *very* different private lives. I do not chase their dreams. Most importantly, get a weekly housecleaning - just trust me on this one - get it early on during the first pregnancy and never stop it.",1,2024-09-17 22:35:59,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/anybody-with-kids-with-adhd-in-this-bowl-can-you-provide-words-of-encouragement-or-wisdomdesperately-want-to-start-a-family,1,144,468

I have ADHD, diagnosed age 20, and I take stimulants. The vast improvement I experienced at 29 when I switched from a normal therapist to an ADHD specific one didn't come from taking the same meds. It came from working with a practitioner with very deep experience with ADHD.

I sort of describe it like strategizing with someone who knows the playbook. You know you, but a good ADHD therapist has seen dozens and dozens of people with your issues. ADHD manifests differently for people, but there are commonalities (hello rejection sensitive dysmorphia). Then there's the brain chemistry, where someone who understands your brain chemistry helps you understand why your attracted to certain people and jobs.

It's been life changing for me. I truly hope you find what helps you be your best.","1

ADHD,Author,Authoran Information Security Architect,8 months,"Maybe save that advice for the person who seems to suggest I am wrong , or yourself, when I said *I* tried therapy and it didn’t work.

I’m not the one unaware that different people have different experiences. I’m not the one throwing unsolicited advice then disregarding the response told it was tried and didn’t work for me ??? I’m not the one telling people what their symptoms are or aren’t. Slow your draw fam.

Also fyi I’m pretty sure the person you’re back up is the one who keeps posting about how they think mental health issues don’t exist thus the therapy over med insistence. Good job","1

ADHD,Other,a Senior Counsel 1,3 months,"I don’t think employers can give traditional accommodations like you would for other conditions. It’s mostly on the individual to adapt their behavior to overcome their particular peccadilloes.

For me, I asked for 2 accommodations. I have a voluntary weekly email summary of all pending matters I send to my boss. I’m not required to, but it helps me stay on track and prevents them dropping out of the blue asking me to give them an update on XYZ which would disrupt my flow. I asked my boss to (1) give me shit if I don’t submit the summary by my self-imposed deadline and (2) to occasionally ask me to forward one of the doc’s on the summary, as it is in its current state.

This works for my ADHD because I cannot miss that deadline to submit the summary; I don’t want to be embarrassed by the lack of progress of a matter that’s described on the summary; and because I know they may randomly “audit” me so I would get caught lying about the status of a doc.

ADHD-aside, this also works because that weekly summary doc is the starting point for our 1:1’s, for any escalations that are needed, keeping them apprised of pertinent deadlines, etc.","2

ADHD,Other,"Jack Henry & Associates, Inc. 1",9 months,"The big, important thing for me seemed to be finding a place where I was actually accepted and supported when I brought my whole self to work. Unfortunately, not everyone can work on my team at my company! I still have days where my manager has to remind me I'm doing great, and even with all of this I still feel some kind of way when I get a message that he wants to talk. But I had to get out of a series of jobs where the only concern was extracting the maximum amount of value out of every second of my effort and into a place that has a policy of having clearly defined goals and kpis for success. Taking the subjectivity out of evaluating my performance actually did a lot for my confidence.

I think being able to understand where the feelings are coming from is a great first step to processing them and building a toolkit you can use to guide yourself through situations when anxiety or RSD are really high. Having someone who understands that I can talk to helps a lot.","3

I keep my social media on an old phone so I can only check it intentionally instead of casual scrolling for a min that turns into an hour.

True or false, it has personally helped me. I also take vitamin b complex, vitamin d3, and feel it gives me a minor assist.

ADHD,Other,an Analyst 1,8 months,"https://www.additudemag.com/resources/

That site has some good resources. If you’re transitioning off meds, you may want to reduce your dosage over a number of months. ADHD, scientifically, means your brain is lacking dopamine so you’ll crave easy dopamine hits (carbs, sugar, etc) which will feel differently than meds. Focus on protein, limit artificial dyes (mainly red and yellow). Prioritize sleep.

If you’re into granola or alternative medicine like me, you can do brain training (EEG biofeedback- in person 2x per week for a few months gave me results), acupuncture, Nootropics or functional mushrooms (supplements that can help with cognitive function that aren’t stimulants).

ADHD,Other,a Senior Manager 1,8 months,"This sounds very difficult. And as someone with severe ADHD, I would also say that her reactions don’t sound related to the condition. While I struggle with “simple adult chores and tasks,” I have no problem with my partner doing things her way since I’m never going to be able to meet her standards. It keeps us both happy.

There may be another mental health or behavioral situation at play (as you note), but regardless of diagnosis it sounds like a very unhealthy dynamic.

I also offer that you both may have responsibility in this—even your statement of “simple adult chores” that you “need” done is rough to read. I don’t know what “she takes care of herself” means, as a person with ADHD often struggles with “care tasks”. I wonder what the routine is when you have cleaned the house—are you happy, relieved, and move on with life? Or do you make a big deal out of it and throw it in her face, or tell her it’s easy and why can’t she do it? Maybe you are just a long-suffering victim, and she definitely should get a diagnosis and treatment for whatever her mood disorder is, but I suspect there is more to the story.

Perhaps going to a shared counselor and/or seeking individual therapy could help. At least you will have a professional who can help and support you.

May I also recommend the book “How to Keep House While Drowning.” You could read it together and discuss how the situations presented by the author align with your wife’s experiences.","3

ADHD,Other,a Partner 1,5 months,"I pretty firmly believe my neuroatypicality has been integral to my success. I can only speak for my practice (fast paced fire drill heavy deal stuff) but my view is that taming the process into something organized just isnt possible, certainly not without unacceptable time sink. So ok the thing i cant do is impossible for everyone, the organizational system will never stay caught up, the process will never stay disciplined, we ultimately all end up playing fire whack a mole by the seat of our pants no matter how hard we fight it.

So what helps with that? Is it trying and failing to impose order on the fundamentally entropic? Or is it a restless mind, zipping around chasing association triggers and sudden sparks of memory, dropping into hard hyperfocus where needed (fueled off adrenaline spikes from urgency) and then falling back to skip around aimlessly until it finds something to dig into, then dig in and keep digging until thats done, then sift around more... i have found the latter to serve me very well.",2,2024-09-17 22:45:26,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/do-you-guys-think-your-adhd-helps-you-solve-complex-problems-with-a-lot-of-infomoving-pieces-or-the-opposite-i-cant-decide,1,159,147

ADHD,Other,Vanguard 1,7 months,"I can't imagine how hard it must be to go off of meds. I've never taken them so I've come up with a lot of coping mechanisms, especially because I'm an engineer and if I'm having a low focus day it can be really hard to do my job.

One of the most helpful coping mechanisms that I developed is derived from the realization that ADHD is a dopamine deficiency. Dopamine helps us focus. Dopamine will also be lower when your hormonal, such as when you're on your period, and other situations. It's natural for dopamine to fluctuate from day to day for people, but for people with ADHD those fluctuations are more noticeable because we have less to begin with.

With dopamine deficiency in mind, I make sure to do two things. I use caffeine to give myself dopamine but I make sure that my tolerance remains low so I have days that I barely use it. Also, when I have a hard meeting coming up or really stressful day at work and I know ahead of time I make sure to do a high dopamine activity that morning.. It can be working out or playing video games or other things... Something that you enjoy that brings you joy that is going to set you off on a high dopamine day. If I don't get a heads up or if a day ends up being lowered dopamine and I need more during the day.. I try to make time to go for a walk during lunch and I try to have social lunches.

I also make sure to never eat lunch at my desk because getting that time away also helps.

I hope this perspective and coping mechanisms help you. I wish you the best of luck.",10,2024-09-17 22:45:54,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/ideas-for-coping-with-work-without-meds-it-has-been-a-while-since-i-had-to-do-my-job-without-adhd-meds-even-medicated-i-had-to,1,160,154

Always question your judgments and remind yourself of what information you’re missing in making that judgment because it will highlight the flaws in your analysis, and therefore in your conclusion.

Okay last thing - what does “having it all figured out” even mean? And is that what you want? Do they have it all figured out bc they bill insane hours? Okay, but is that what you want? Do they have it all figured out because they are ultra organized? But do you even like being organized or do you enjoy the spiciness that comes with a bit of chaos?

You’ve gotta know who you are and what you value and anchor yourself to that",2,2024-09-17 22:46:45,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/i-feel-a-weird-competitive-jealousy-towards-other-adhd-lawyers-who-seem-to-have-it-all-figured-out-its-motivating-but-also,1,163,190

ADHD,Other,a Legal Counsel 1,4 months,"IMHO, I think the type of law one is practicing as an attorney with ADHD makes a huge difference on “having it figured out”. My ADHD never caused a problem as a criminal defense attorney or prosecutor for me (quick turnarounds, on my feet in court, etc.).

ADHD,Other,a Counsel 1,4 months,SC1 I keep trying to develop the “not leaving the goddamn office until it’s done” tactic to entering my billing for the day and somehow manage to convince myself every night that I’ll do it on the train or when I get home (and I don’t). Any tips for how to force yourself into staying to power through? Lolol,"1

ADHD,Other,a Senior Counsel 1,4 months,"Yea actually. The best way I’ve found to manage my ADHD is to actively call out when it’s rearing its ugly head. Knowing is half the battle. E.g. When I reach for snacks I ask “are you hungry or are you bored? If you’re hungry are you actually hungry or did you not take your meds and are craving dopamine?” Just that helped me lose 10 lbs. I digress.

As part of that strategy, I’ve classified a certain line of thinking and given it a derogatory label. It leads to a mild shaming effect which can be effective if harnessed properly.

While crude I’ll share it with you for academic purposes: “whore logic.” It’s probably now a 20+ year old Tucker Max reference describing the mental gymnastics a young woman uses to justify engaging in sexual activity with someone they shouldn’t. Not that I’ve got anything against promiscuity, it’s just a really good sharp biting label and I’ve repurposed it for my own needs to just mean BS mental gymnastics. Allow me to demonstrate:

“I’m going to start that diet on Monday, so I should have one last hurrah!”

“Even though I’ve never woken up before 8am, I’ll get up at 6am tomorrow and do that HW (20 pg term paper) that’s due in first period.”

*waking up on a random Wednesday* “I don’t want to go to work. Oh, I think I just so happen to coincidentally also feel sick, so I guess I should call in!”

“I’ll do it later when I feel like it.”

“I’ll do the dishes in the morning.”

“I’ll fold the laundry before bed.”

“I can change him!”

“I’m gonna win her back!”

So now when I think, “ah I’ll do it when I get home” my reflexive mental response is: whore logic. And then I shamefully realize the label is apt, I’ve literally never completed any work (that I’ve been putting off) once I go home that didn’t have a deadline that night.

It’s entirely stupid. But next time you try to lie to yourself that you’ll do it when you get home, tell yourself “that’s whore logic” and see what happens.","1

ADHD,Author,a SR. Online Community Manager 1,9 months,"I would talk to your doctor and see if maybe you try another ADHD med if they think that might help. Also, talk to them about pairing up with an anti-depressant as well. It's probably a multi-layered issue.

I am on and have been for years an anti-depressant that helps with anxiety, and I was feeling similar. I'm in my mid-forties, female, and lacking energy, among other things. I tested everything and had no issues with hormones or thyroid, and then I was diagnosed with ADHD. So now I am on Adderall XR in the morning and Lexapro in the evening, and I finally feel balanced. My energy is back and I feel so much better.

In my experience, in dealing with depression for almost 30 years, if you aren't treating depression, it really doesn't matter what else you are treating; it will always be the thing that causes the most issues; it is mentally and physically consuming and exhausting.

ADHD,Author,Ohio Middle School 1,9 months,"It may also be a good time to find a psychologist. Someone who works specifically with ADHD & Depression and to talk about what is going on.

In addition, this is the time of year when it is particularly difficult for people who have Seasonal Affect Disorder (SAD). You may not be getting enough light. If you find it almost impossible to get out of bed on rainy or dark days, you may want to look into this. The easiest way to help with this is to sit under grow lights several times a day. They have special lights they sell on Amazon for SAD or you can buy the white “grow light” light bulb and put it in a lamp that will shine on you while you are sitting near it. It can’t hurt and you may find you start feeling better.

Finally, if you go in to check your hormones, have them check your ferritin (specific iron level that can cause excessive sleepiness if you are to low), your B levels and your folate levels. B effects energy and folate effects your mental health.
I found out I don’t absorb/process folic acid so I was really struggling for a bit. Started taking L-methylfolate ( you can get this as a prescription or in Smarty Pants vitamins-check the label) and it made a big difference in my mood and energy.

ADHD,Other,Authora DOG Trainer,9 months,"Omg where to begin

1. The Grocery Store Odyssey- Imagine going to the grocery store for milk and ending up with a cart full of everything but milk. You start in the dairy section, but then a colorful cereal box catches your eye. Before you know it, you're in the snack aisle, contemplating the nutritional value of different types of nuts. An hour later, you're at the checkout with a bewildering assortment of items, and as you leave the store, you realize you forgot the milk.

2. The Forgotten Password Saga- You sit down at your computer to pay a bill, but first, you need to log in. You can't remember your password, so you start the reset process. While waiting for the reset email, you notice an interesting article in your inbox. Two hours later, you've fallen down a rabbit hole of articles, and the bill remains unpaid. And you still haven't reset your password.

3. The Mysterious Case of the Lost Keys- You're already late and can't find your keys. As you search, you stumble upon a book you'd been meaning to read. You get so engrossed in the first chapter that you forget about the keys (and your appointment) entirely. Eventually, you find the keys in the fridge, next to the butter – a mystery for another day.

4. The Multi-Tasking Mayhem- You decide to cook dinner while listening to a podcast and texting a friend. Halfway through, you get so involved in a text conversation that you completely forget about the food on the stove. The result? A very interesting, albeit unintended, new recipe and a slightly smoky kitchen.

5. The Never-Ending Online Shopping Loop- You go online to buy a specific item, but somehow end up comparing reviews for a completely unrelated product. Hours later, you've got 15 tabs open, haven't bought anything, and can't even remember what you originally wanted to purchase.",4,2024-09-17 22:47:27,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/i-am-not-only-a-dog-trainer-but-a-stand-up-comedian-i-was-things-about-doing-a-bit-on-adhd-i-have-corny-stories-but-i-wanted-to-hear,1,165,216

ADHD,Other,Authora DOG Trainer,9 months,"I managed to get a referral from my primary care doc to see the Psychiatrist who referred me to an ADHD specialist. I didn’t like any of this but, I was actually looking forward to finally, maybe, getting ANY answer for why I am constantly at war with itself.

Today was my appointment!

I was proud that I had arrived in plenty of time to fill out the paperwork and had set up an over elaborate system of memory crutches to make sure I walked in with my insurance card, ID, and everything I could possibly need. With head lifted high, I confidently approached the counter to check in and gave my name. The overly nice assistant barely looked down as she deftly clicked the keys. She looked at her screen, looked at me, then began tapping away faster and faster while becoming increasingly more concentrated on the screen. Then I got the dreaded half sigh with a twist of “huuuum”
I’ve had years of hearing that sound, but my overconfidence would not let me give in.

“I know I’m super early” I said as if I would certainly receive patient of the month accolades for what any non-divergent would consider annoyingly mundane. “Would you please check for a later appointment?”

After several minutes that seemed like an eternity, she said, “Oh, here it is! Ummm, your appointment isn’t until NEXT Thursday.”
Without a millisecond of second thought, I blurted out, “Well, at least now you know why I’m here”.

Prologue: I finally got the appointment and took an endless tsunami of what I thought were silly tests.

HR is not your friend. Never trust those SOBs. Tell them you have a disability and you paint a target on your back. They will lie, fabricate and commit fraud to cover the company’s butt and they don't care about you in the slightest.

ADHD,Author,an Office Business Leader 1,7 months,"The struggle is real - I went unmediated for almost 50 years. The decision to utilize meditation as a tool has been very helpful. I have also adjusted my diet, I have greatly reduced my simple carbohydrate intake and focus on higher protein diet with many rich green vegetables. Prior to starting adhd prescription, I started to utilized a few supplements; omega 3 fatty acids, magnesium glycinate, zinc and L-tyrosine. I am not a doctor, please consult a physician for products that are appropriate for you.

Additionally, I have found that using an ADHD timer can help with time management.

Procrastination is a real issue, but learning to organize tasks that create little dopamine wins can help transition your focus onto larger tasks that require more focus. ADHDers typically are not able to jump into big tasks at the beginning of the day. We need to build up our dopamine.

Also on the topic of time management and over commitment- we offen calculate the time it takes to complete a task as the “time” we envisioned as doing the task. We very often forget the perp work time before beginning the task, proofing the work, etc. so it isn’t always just our constant adhd jumping from task to task, but that we absolutely over commit.

One final note: ADHD is a protected medical disability condition under Americans with Disability Acts (ADA). If you are diagnosed and continue to struggle at the job requisites, you can request an ADA accommodation. You, your physician, and our employer will work together to strategize what appropriate accommodations can be made to help ensure your continued success.",,2024-09-17 22:48:21,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/does-anyone-here-work-9-5-i-have-adhd-and-of-course-i-always-struggle-with-deadlines-and-time-management-in-general-im-in,1,167,255

ADHD,Other,Deloitte 2,10 months,"Vyvanse/Elvanse drastically reduced my anxiety. Turns out not being able to do things I needed to do was very anxiety-provoking lol.

Adderall made my anxiety worse at higher doses and made me fall asleep at lower ones. Haven’t tried any other ADHD meds but between those two, Vyvanse is much ‘smoother’ so I don’t get that anxiety spike like with Adderall.

I’ve been on every anti-anxiety and antidepressant med under the sun and they all did either nothing or made me worse. The only exception was Wellbutrin which I took before the ADHD diagnosis.

It isn't a shield though. It should t protect you. If you can't fulfill the role you shouldn't be in it, but if you occasionally fall off performance wise, and there's an open discussion about it, you may get some understanding. Managers are people and will more often than not have some empathy.

If you’re in an established, high seniority or long tenure role, being open about your ADHD encourages others to break the stigma, and may lead others to seek a proper diagnosis! Breaking stigmas around mental health is so important, but not everyone is in a position to do so. If you can, do.
If you’re in a work culture or role that you feel would not be positively impacted by such candor, or you require accommodations that without which would significantly affect your ability to perform your duties, you may decide to seek legally binding, formal accommodations.",12,2024-09-17 22:55:09,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/is-it-fair-to-say-mention-to-my-manager-that-im-diagnosed-with-adhd-if-so-will-that-protect-me-from-being-fired-in-the-future,1,174,31

It’s not a miracle solution by any means, I had to work on adapting and personal life adjustments as well, but two years in I can see a HUGE difference. I was never medicated because of high academic achievement and Drs calling it “mild” (and as an adult I just got scared), so after leaving firm life I was able to manage my ADHD so much better with environmental changes, like starting new hobbies that helped focus my attention off work and having more time to also just be “bored” when I feel burnout coming.

ADHD,Author,a Trial Attorney 1,7 months,"Wait, a psychiatrist should be prescribing you the medication anyway. Find an online doctor or a cash only doctor. They are much better than insurance doctors. I’ve had the same psychiatrist for over a decade and it’s the best physician I’ve had. The Dr actually cares! It’s weird. It’s not cheap ($280/hour and mandatory visits every 3 months) but it is priceless. If you take any other type of medication, like an SSRI, oral contraceptive, ANYTHING, using the same pharmacy for all scripts and obviously escripts now for ADHD and all controlled meds, gets you priority over everyone else who isn’t a regular patient of the pharmacy. Unfortunately if you only take ADHD meds, you don’t get the same advantage of being considered a regular patient at the pharmacy. There is no shortage, there is a monthly allocation per pharmacy and regular pharmacy patients get priority. Before understanding this, and before escripts, I once drove to 11 pharmacies until I found one pharmacy in a community of elderly people that could fill my script after having been out of meds for weeks.

A tiny bit better. I still feel extremely exhausted and drained by all of the corporate politics and hoops. But I was able to work on resetting my expectations and reframing my mindset a bit.

I think what also really helped was leaning into trying to build connections with other people while I’m at work (difficult!) and finding new hobbies/ways of coping when I’m outside of work so work feels less all encompassing.

I’m still pretty stressed and don’t see it as a long term place for me, but I’m hoping that I’ll be able to at least cope with it long enough until things in the market improve and I can find a better home.","3

ADHD,Other,a Staff Software Engineer 1,a year,"I think that hypothesis is a coping mechanism, an overactive desire to find a satisfying reason for, or upside to, a negative occurrence that doesn't have either.

Rephrasing your second question since I'm not sure I understand it -- you're asking if I had gotten a diagnosis as a child, but no treatment, whether I could have come to view ADHD as a positive because I suffered through it for my entire childhood?

I don't really see how. I didn't get diagnosed until I was an adult, so I did suffer through my entire childhood with it, and a number of my adult years, too. I don't think knowing I had ADHD would have changed anything unless it resulted in me getting treated.

I could kind of see that second point being a thing a parent might tell themselves to try to justify not treating their kid's ADHD?","3

ADHD,Other,a Staff Software Engineer 1,a year,"Not every creative/outside-the-box-thinking person has ADHD -- being associated with it doesn't mean it's caused by it or vice-versa. I do benefit from creativity in the engineering sense, but it's not like I lose the creativity when I take my meds. That would seem to suggest it's separate from the ADHD?

Impulsiveness is not something that benefits me, my job involves a lot of meticulous planning and careful execution. I'm known for being able to lead the most complex projects at my company, a task that is infinitely harder when I can't keep my attention on the task for longer than a few minutes at a time.

Infectious energy sounds like hyperactivity, which I don't have (I have inattentive-type).","1

ADHD,Author,Authora Customer Service Representative,a year,"No, of course not every creative, out-of-the-box thinker has ADHD, but I think because we've had to come up with solutions to our personal challenges means that our creativity has become interwoven with how we interact with the world.

And meds don't just magically remove our ADHD symptoms. I still have ADHD symptoms when I take my meds. They can make them more manageable. I've been taking various meds since I was 8 and I've never felt like I don't have ADHD while taking them. The times that I feel like my ADHD doesn't get in the way of accomplishing things is when I don't resist it, set myself up for success, work with it, and embrace the way my mind works.

In regards to impulsivity, yes, for me it's definitely created some challenging and unpleasant situations. But it's also allowed me to pursue things that I might not have otherwise because I talked myself out of it. For instance, I impulsively created this bowl, well before I was familiar with Fishbowl. Now we have almost 21k members who are supportive of each other, offer advice, and help each other get different perspectives.


As far as infectious enthusiasm goes, this one happens to be one people tell me I have and I was diagnosed with ADD, primarily innatentive type.

Everyone's ADHD expresses itself differently in each person. I would encourage you to occasionally think of the ways that your ADHD might be benefiting you.

I didn't really even understand what ADHD actually is until my late 20s. And even now, in my late 30s I'm still learning about new aspects I didn't realize were related.

I hope you're able to develop a new relationship with your ADHD being a potential ally, especially when we don't cut it's wings with shame. I think it has so much more potential than you're giving it credit.

Best of luck to you! 🍀🪽","2

When I was in school, the Autism and Asperger’s kids were all separated out from the general population (along with those with Downs, Cerebral Palsy, severe intellectual disabilities, etc) and hidden away like they were freaks.

ADHD,Other,Baker Tilly 1,10 months,"I would definitely recommend doing some reading on autism spectrum disorder to get a better understanding of what it actually is, how it manifests in women, and specifically adult diagnosis. It does still have a somewhat negative connotation in some circles but I think you’ll find there a lot of people, again especially women, who are getting these same late in life diagnoses.

As far as “high functioning” versus “low functioning,” these are terms that are less in use today. Autism isn’t about levels of “functioning” so much as it is about what level of support someone needs, so for example someone who needs a one on one support aid during their waking hours would have high support needs versus someone who meets with a specialist weekly to discuss coping mechanisms would have low support needs.

And I do totally get what you’re saying with being thrown off. It caught me off guard and I was actually a little offended when my husband suggested he thought I may have adhd and autism. I’m still not sure he’s right, but the more I’ve learned the less that seems like a negative to me and the more I think yeah that may be true and I just didn’t realize those quirks are actually my neurospicy brain.","1

ADHD,Author,a Planning and Purchasing Manager 1,10 months,"First of all, it’s a confusing process obtaining a diagnosis and different doctors will often diagnose different things depending on the symptoms you are facing at that time. So don’t let the change in your symptoms concern you right off the bat. Both Autism & ADHD (ADD is now under this umbrella) share many of the same symptoms. Symptoms can even co-mingle and cause additional symptoms that lean one way or another. This includes tonality in your voice; ie. distractions impacting your conversation (causing aggravation) versus a lack of empathy.

Secondly, there is also a newer classification, AuDHD, for those how exhibit a heavy mix of Autistic and ADHD behaviors/symptoms. What matters most is the identification of neurodivergence in its many forms and addressing the underlying conditions. For instance, in this situation mindfulness and mental rehearsals could provide you a significant opportunity to help with the tonality in your voice.

Vyvanse keeps me awake late into the night even though I take it early in the day so I am on my phone until I fall asleep.

Not at all suggesting that everyone who claims to have it is absolutely correct/honest; nor that it may be misdiagnosed in some instances. I think for many of us (myself included), it was just jarring to learn that literal decades of feeling like an incompetent person who could never measure up was not because that was true, but because science had neglected to account for how women are different and therefore I went undiagnosed until my early 30's.",5,2024-09-17 23:05:07,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/ive-been-noticing-virtually-everyone-i-know-will-mention-on-occasion-oh-thats-my-adhd-or-outright-say-they-have-adhd-among,1,194,44

ADHD,Author,a Director 1,8 months,"I would talk to your doctor; straterra is an antidepressant and should be helping with anxiety. The fact you are having an opposite reaction might mean it’s not a good fit for you.

A lot of us go through several meds until we find the right fit; so, you’re in good company 🙂 but it’s worth a call to check in with a professional with how you are feeling.",2,2024-09-17 23:07:22,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/i-am-really-spiraling-recently-my-job-has-been-very-stressful-i-have-recently-been-diagnosed-with-adhd-and-currently-taking-straterra,1,199,117
ADHD,Other,an Account Manager 1,8 months,"^^ agree with this! I was on Strattera and it was very ineffective for me. Switched to Vyvanse and it’s night and day. I still deal with anxiety (likely due to stress of job), but focus and executive functioning has improved.

1. I live in Illinois where we do not have this requirement.

2. I did not make it through life “perfectly fine” without meds. Instead, I was gaslit by my parents and even relatives who were doctors because they were ignorant to the fact that one can be in gifted programs yet still suffer from ADHD

3. Before getting treatment, and even after, I’ve done talk therapy to try and manage my symptoms, so nice job assuming there’s no other documentation.

Ignorance should be bliss, but you don’t come off blissful at all. Just bitter. I hope you’re okay over there, and I’m sorry your experiences were rough, but I’d err on the side of not letting that frustrated energy be so outward and driving dialogue based off assumptions that others had to adhere to the same experience as you.

Not only was I diagnosed only three years ago, before that I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety and insomnia. Being a woman and of color for that matter, I was gaslit my entire life, especially in school. I had to actively fight and I mean fight to achieve academic success, maintain my anxiety while trying relentlessly to combat my depression through any means possible. All my life I felt like I was running a race in mud while others were on pavement. My diagnosis changed my life, lessened my depression, fixed my insomnia and manages my anxiety. I can manage them all without countless medications all because I’m getting treated for my ADHD. So yeah there are shortages but some people have been struggling their entire lives, under different circumstances to get through life and if there’s a hope of assistance then by all means they should cease it. Since I got diagnosed and treated almost three years ago, I’ve gotten my EMBA while working full time and part time (to pay for school), landed my dream job at a great firm and just got accepted to Harvard. People’s lives literally change when properly treated for the barriers that hold them back. So instead of casting a wide net of assumptions based upon your experience, consider engaging in a dialogue that provides you with an alternative perspective. Take your struggles and channel it to help someone else or better yet create change that prevents what happened to you from
happening to someone else.","2

Alert? Bored? Distracted? Focused?)

Once get some baselines you can start tinkering with an individual factor.

Personally, I can’t have any caffeine after 3pm; need to be phone free an hour before bed; and 30 min session (in the 1-2 hours before bed) of certain twitchy videogames will turn the monkey part of my brain off so I can sleep.

I forgo breakfast and lunch during work, instead relying on coffee with a little heavy cream (no sugar) and maybe a hard boiled egg or string cheese and lots of water. Gym 3x a week after work but I can’t do it too early or I get a surge of energy. If I have time, a hot tub soak in the evening is clutch and will knock me out

ADHD,Author,Authoran Associate Marketing Manager,9 months,"Some feedback is around my project management and planning skills. I am trying to find a work flow system to keep everything organized. We don’t have project managers on our projects. It’s been a struggle to properly prepare; then everything feels like it’s chaotic and rushed. Too many deliverables in a short period of time forces me to put myself (my projects last) and has created a habit of asking for last minute document reviews without enough notice. I don’t blame them. I would be frustrated too, but I honestly can’t focus on them because there are other priorities with pressing deadlines.",,2024-09-17 23:13:04,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/any-advice-on-knowing-when-a-career-isnt-right-for-you-i-started-in-sales-received-my-mba-and-pivoted-into-marketing-in-my-marketing-dqsf-5,2,210,86
ADHD,Other,a Marketing Manager 1,9 months,"All the feedback I’ve seen so far is pretty accurate. But - here is some that I hope you can use immediately. I find that projects with many deliverables and deadlines are hard to manage without a good tool to keep track. If your manager is not willing to provide one, try entering everything into one large excel document and be sure to enter dates for each step. Second, hopefully your boss is willing to back you up on time lines and keeping others accountable - set up SOPs where possible to set expectations that all agree on. Third - be very transparent, let others know as soon as a deliverable looks like it might be late. And finally, set aside more time for each deliverable, pad your time a bit and and never agree to anything you know you won’t make on time. If you have to, make sure everyone knows that you don’t believe it can be done in the assigned time and why.

And finally - look for a new job. It sounds like you are not getting the support you need to succeed.

Good luck!","3

ADHD,Other,a Marketing Associate 1,9 months,it's hard to improve when your leaders don't provide you with the feedback and tools necessary to do so.

ADHD,Author,,6 months,"Hi!
Here’s what I´d suggest:
get clear on what specifically makes it hard for you to delegate?
Usually it’s something along the lines of being afraid that the work won’t be done exactly how we like it, not having time to explain & go in details, thinking we’ve got to do it all on our own... think about your reasons and then decide what way of thinking will be more useful to protect yourself, your wellbeing and great productivity.

Then, instead of trying to delegate it all at once and make a huge step, think about the first small step you can make: what is one task you feel ok to delegate? Just one. Then add another one, and another one.

Also, think about how you want to stay up to date with those tasks you’ve delegated? Do you wish a person to give you an update once/day, once/week..?

ADHD,Author,a Chief Executive Officer 1,6 months,"The responses above are both very good.
Also, inability to delegate could mean:
- you don’t know what to delegate
- you don’t trust yourself to give good directions
- you don’t trust others to do the work.
- there is an underlying or subconscious fear - for example you feel that it is somehow unjust to delegate or you’re afraid the person will do a better job than you and take your job from you

If you’re not sure what task to delegate, have a conversation with a colleague, explain all the things on your list, and get their opinion on the things they could take off your plate.

Then hand over the task with clear instructions and a deadline, and check in when it’s due. Even if it is a tiny task, it gets things started for you and the next one gets easier.

In the meantime - let go and trust. You might find the person does a better job than you would, in which case that is awesome. That person may come to you asking for more work and suggesting things they can do to help.

The ideal manager doesn’t work on things, they make it easy for other people to work on things.

But I think disciplining yourself to at least getting stuff done in the first couple of hours before you start to slack.

Obviously ADD is always going to be an issue but just don't make it a crutch. I find if you make problems things they become problems. I think realization is probably one of the most important things.

Put your list in front of your face so you have a reminder and discipline yourself into finishing the task. Lastly don't let anybody know that you have ADD.

ADHD,Other,a Planning and Purchasing Manager 1,2 months,"Yes, especially when you take into account all of the synthetic chemicals American food is made with. Just food colorings alone are proven to increase ADHD symptoms or falsely present as an ADHD symptom. Our metabolism also plays a role in this process as well. When it’s thrown off by things we should not or cannot consume it cannot produce a balanced environment for your brain and body to work properly. If you want to prioritize tweaks to your diet to see if it changes anything for you, I would remove all synthetic ingredients from your diet. Focus on the artificial food colorings to start (give it 30-60 days to see if anything improves), then consider removal of highly processed foods. Cooking at home with fresh, organically grown produce and locally sourced grass fed meats is also a great step towards this goal and overall health.

ADHD,Other,a Vice President 1,2 months,"Like correlation that ADHD is a result of diet or that we struggle with our eating because of ADHD?

If the latter, it's well studied that obesity is a commodity of ADHD. Personally, it's hell for me to maintain a healthy diet. I have no fullness cues, and eat for the dopamine when tired/overstimulated/stressed because my symptoms aren't manageable, etc. I didn't think the ""impulsive"" type applied to me because I'm not outwardly so, but I realize now that it applies to patterns like shopping and eating. I know I don't need to eat more, but I will not be able to turn that drive off if it gets in my head I want to eat something, and then everything becomes a Pringle -- once I start i can't stop, be it chips, a bag of nuts, random croutons in my pantry, bunch of grapes...you name it. Anything in that quantity isn't good for you regardless of nutritional value. If I get a craving in my head like a specific fast/takeout food, it's like a motor driving me to order and I can't stop thinking about it.

I'm shocked at how quickly I put it on when I was off meds. And it was a cycle: Depressed over the way I looked and no energy because I wasn't working out so...I ate more. I found the right dose and lost 25lbs over the last year. Ofc the appetite suppression helped, but I still eat a healthy amount of calories for my size, don't struggle with cravings, and make healthier choices. Also have more discipline to workout.

but try to gradually wean yourself off of it by taking 1/3 of the pill, 1/2, and then 1 quarter until your done and find a nice supplement that you can take to replace it like St, John’s Wort, Ashwaganda, Theanine, or Magnesium supplements

The only thing about supplements is that they are way more expensive than medication, but they are so much more worth it because there is no side effects and you can never overdose or experience any health complications because of them unless you’re allergic or something like that and you can even combine all of these supplements together if you feel as if one doesn’t work …I take about nine supplements a day because I was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar, and I feel 100% better than I ever did when I was on all of the antidepressants and antipsychotics that they gave me at the hospital so Please please consider this option.

When it comes to presenting itself, I like to write 1-3 clear points points per slide in my notes (not in the deck) ; hit those, and then move on. This also allows you to practice beforehand, which might help with your speech issues.

ADHD,Other,Ondot systems 1,9 months,"I was diagnosed with ADD by a psychiatrist (who had 10 years of prior experience as a neurosurgeon). I had been working with him for six months to find the right combination of meds to treat the depression that I had struggled with for years. I shared that I had to put in extra hours on weekends and after the office cleared out during the week. I just assumed that I had to put in the extra hours because I was not good at managing my time or because I was a lousy employee. He asked me to describe my working conditions and I explained that I would forward all calls to voicemail and ignore email messages in order to get some work cranked out. This didn’t help because associates would then stop by my desk end interrupt my work. It would take me 20 minutes to get back to a productive pace after that. He then started asking to questions about school and college.
I have found that if I forget to take my depression meds (Wellbutrin and Cymbalta) and or if I do not take my TraZadone at night (an old Depression med with a side effect of drowsiness) that is prescribed for anyone who has trouble sleeping, I am incredibly groggy the next day.",,2024-09-17 23:17:11,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/ive-noticed-on-days-i-dont-take-my-medication-i-am-very-sleepy-all-day-is-taking-the-medication-to-avoid-sleepiness-and-feel,1,221,192

ADHD,Other,an Associate 4,8 months,"Make sure to go to a psychiatrist. Apparently you can go to other doctors for a diagnosis and medication, which is shocking to me, but truly no one will better understand it than a psychiatrist.

Unfortunately, there can still be problems. There are some psychiatrists who don’t think ADHD is real… Others can view your symptoms and think it’s ADHD, even though it’s burnout or anxiety or depression; or sometimes it’s that they view it as burnout or anxiety or depression, even though it’s ADHD.

Do some research into doctors and how they diagnose. I was diagnosed several years ago, and my doctor had an actual program/test that somehow tracked my attention and cognitive function. Wish I could remember what it’s called. To me, that’s the way it should be done because it’s easy for people to read the DSM and then tell a doctor they have those symptoms, and that’s how we end up with so many people wrongfully diagnosed and so many people thinking ADHD is fake.

Also, I think a good doctor wouldn’t ask you why you have ADHD because a lot of people don’t know that what they experience isn’t normal, so they wouldn’t know to talk about it. A good doctor should be asking you questions and figuring it out from your answers.

Hoping for your sake that it’s just burnout because that’s much more manageable, but good luck at your appointment!",2,2024-09-17 23:31:19,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/having-a-hard-time-advocating-for-myself-during-adhd-evaluations-ive-had-two-with-different-results-so-im-going-to-seek-a,1,230,26

ADHD,Other,a Field Project Manager 1,4 months,"When I got diagnosed at 40, the specialist was actually shocked at how successful I've been. He noted that I gravitated to self managing without realizing it. I always needed a job that was a combination of using my mind and using my hands. The longest I ever stayed with a job was running my own plumbing company. Everything else I moved on to something totally new after one or two years, basically when I had the role completely mastered and nothing was new to me.

But the diagnosis allowed me to reflect and question just how much more I'd have accomplished if I hadn't struggled my entire life with it. All the times I felt stuck and couldn't do something I knew I needed to do because I simply didn't want to do it. The routine things like writing large quotes and having to wait until something in me kicked in to do it and then spending 15 hours on only that task while I had the motivation for that particular thing.

I was always high achieving and nobody noticed when I was young. Because I was a sponge, I didn't need to do the homework and my teachers always let me slide on it because I was an active classroom participant and aced tests. I'd end up with an A because they didn't hold all the zero assignments against me. Fourth grade teacher told my parents I was one of the smartest kids he'd taught in like a 20 year career, but was also one of the laziest, lol.

But I seriously wonder what I could have done if so many things hadn't been such a silent struggle.

My husband was diagnosed by my son’s dr during a visit or two lol- he had no idea until he was an adult. A good friend of mine was diagnosed with adhd when she was in her 40s. My husband takes Adderall when he needs it (any type of paperwork work for his business). Adderall is a stimulant and works immediately (it’s short acting) so he can take it 2 /3 days in a row to catch up on the business paperwork he was avoiding. Then he might not take it for 2-3 weeks. My friend (female) is on Strattera which is a non stimulant. This is a long acting drug. It takes like up to 4-6 weeks to fully work (for some maybe a little sooner)and she takes it daily. People with heart issues tend to try strattera because it’s not a stimulant. My son was on different stimulants (Concerta,, Adderall). As a child we did medicate him. He was profoundly inattentive (I volunteered in the class weekly and omg it was so obvious ). Anyway as he developed he needed meds from different families (all stimulants). He refused to take when in grades 8-HS. He’d cheek the meds and spit it out somewhere. He was so sneaky.

ADHD,Author,Authora Human Resource Manager,6 months,"Can you give me an example of how you’ve answered this question for yourself lately?
I volunteer with my kids sports, I help fundraise foe the school, I volunteer on school field trips when my schedule allows. I bake cookies for my neighbour or have tea or wine with other neighbours on an every other month basis. I keep in touch with close friends, I speak to my parents every other day. I ensure my children have friends over and we rotate those friends, I offer to other parents to take their kids when we go somewhere fun to give those parents a break. When I borrow books from the library, I make time to chat with the staff and patrons.
I am not sure if I have any more time to help others. I genuinely think I’m a decent person that contributes positively to my community.","1

There are plenty of other areas you can work within that focus less on performing tasks quickly and more on patient interaction.

Many facilities will even provide on the job training, and people typically find this type of work very rewarding. You could also consider working in Hospice or behavioral health. Where else could you use your license if you choose to continue to work as a phlebotomist? Perhaps you could look into working in a physicians office, long term care facility, blood donation center, research lab…to name a few. Think about why you went into healthcare, what you enjoy about the work, then think of your strengths. What can you do with them? I think it’s important to acknowledge areas in which we are not the strongest, but these areas don’t define you. Work with them vs letting them work against you. Also, don’t focus on your age. 50 isn’t old. Many women in their 50s change their career paths entirely, and even start their own businesses. You can also work with a physician, thinking functional medicine, or hormone specialist, to explore nutritional / supplement support to help you manage the “typical 50 year old woman stuff” if you feel this is holding you back in some way.

Unfortunately, and speaking as someone who has it, untreated or under-treated ADHD just isn’t a legitimate reason for workplace underperformance. It’s not a transient condition like an episode of major depression and its symptoms are literally the antithesis of what is required of you in most corporate workplaces.

Of course, it is inappropriate of your manager to put you down - that is workplace bullying and itself is a reason to look elsewhere. But most other corporate jobs are going to have similar demands, so you either need to find an unusual role that caters to your limitations or find a sustainable approach to self-management such that you can meet those demands.",4,2024-09-17 23:48:01,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/got-put-on-a-30-day-coaching-plan-at-american-express-amex-is-this-the-same-as-pip-will-i-get-fired-in-30-days-if-things-dont-improve-ui34-5,1,262,211

Authoritarianism is not even the worst. It's bad, but micromanaging is far worse for me and my psyche.
When authoritarianism, I can separate myself from the work and be a robot. I didn't live it, and I must emotionally divorce myself from the work. But I can manage.

Micromanaging has the negatives of authoritarianism, but the micro part prevents me from being able to tamp down my emotional/professional dedication to the work. This crushes my soul.

I do best with a laissez -faire manager:
* Available when needed
* Responsive when I reach out
* Trusts me and believes in my competence/talent/integrity

My law firm is that of a solo practitioner -- my clients are my bosses.

I also serve as a project director for some non-profits. These organizations interact with me in the laissez-faire style referenced above.

Perhaps get commentary from each teacher and it’ll leave you with a good place to start when meeting with a psychologist. Start with therapy, where they can diagnose as well as provide coping mechanisms before deciding if medication is an option. More importantly, don’t always settle with the first dr.

ADHD,Other,a Senior Research Analyst 1,10 months,"Honestly, if she's already a teenager, may be worth just talking to her pediatrician/primary care about trying stimulants. Its really difficult to get tested right now, it'll take months and because ADHD presents very differently in women AND she's already ""grown out"" of what is often considered a childhood disease by professionals there's a stronger chance she'll be misdiagnosed.

I went through the full testing process when I was 23 and was ultimately denied because my IQ (don't remember the score but it's a fake number anyway) and grades (B average) were too high, even though I scored about 50% in listening comprehension and took like 45 minutes to fill out my basic contact form. I paid like $400 for that just to go to my regular doctor and ask to try stimulants.

ADHD,Other,Ingka Group 1,10 months,"Hi! Been through this 4 times now as literally my whole family is ND. Depends on your insurance. Most need you to start with Pediatrician or Gen Practice doctor and get a referral in order to get full coverage on testing. From there, you schedule with a Neuropsychologist or Doctor of psychology. This is different than a Psychiatrist as Psychiatrists are mainly concerned with prescribing medication and they typically prefer you already have a diagnosis before seeing them. The Psychologist will do an initial intake meeting with parents only to discuss patient concerns/goals/ health/ trauma history / etc. for the assessments. If you can afford it, I would just go ahead and request the autism evaluation now. Lots of women and girls get missed and there is a lot of overlap with ADHD. From there, they will schedule 1-2 testing sessions with kiddo that can take several hours. After that, the psychologist will analyze the data and write their report. Then, they will schedule a meeting to review their findings with you. You COULD have your kiddo attend that meeting or you could not. Up to you. From there, i would recommend just having their regular doctor prescribe any medication if you guys decide to go that route because it’s much less expensive doing it that way.",2,2024-09-17 23:49:06,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/my-teenage-daughter-has-shown-numerous-signs-of-adhd-for-a-few-years-and-i-have-finally-been-able-to-convince-the-wife-for,1,266,243

ADHD,Other,a Senior Associate 1,7 months,"Sounds like you need a therapist you click well with. This is going to take some work on your part but finding a practice that aligns with your personal beliefs is a good start. Meds aren’t magic and I feel they work best when combined with therapy, they aren’t substitutes. If you’re adhd you are on the spectrum however mild it may be (it is a spectrum after all). The immediate concern is your safety, I’d advise you to check in with the suicide prevention hotline or check your company’s benefits for immediate access to a mental health professional. Depending on the severity of your symptoms they might suggest a short term in patient facility. If you’re thinking “but work…”. They can’t and won’t fire you for a short term hospital stay. You don’t need to say for what, they only need to know you’re staying in a hospital and will be out as soon as possible.",,2024-09-18 12:15:21,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/im-so-damn-lonely-i-have-no-friends-no-relationships-my-health-has-pretty-much-nixed-all-my-hobbies-at-work-i-dont-fit-in-i-have,1,272,30

ADHD,Author,a Portfolio Associate 1,6 months,"I would recommend that you read The Power of Habit. When I am on point with my habits, I am even 10 minutes early. But it is about creating systems and programming them into your daily routines. When I don’t do that, I revert back and that causes so much stress and anxiety. Nowadays I prepare all my suits on Saturday along with all my jewelry, etc. etc. and I have it separated in the bathroom where I shower. When I get ready, I use the timer. I have an echo dot when I get ready and I set it up in five minutes increments. I choose clothes that is smart, but I don’t have to do a ton of things in order to get ready. Same with my make up. Believe it or not having an Alexa in every room has really helped me. I set timers, reminders, alarms, etc… I also meal prep for the entire week. I go food shopping on a Friday night or Saturday morning and spend Saturday morning cleaning and cooking. It doesn’t always work perfectly. But it’s all about planning and reprogramming our brains in a way that’s easy. For example regarding my keys I kept losing them over and over again so I ended up just engaging an electronic system. Also, I have a process to have my keys in the same place every single day with my key fobs, etc. etc.. message me separately if you want and I can give you some of the other tools that I use. It is possible to do so I promise it is. I never knew that I had ADD until my child was diagnosed, and I was asked to get myself diagnosed. ￼ We see time differently. Five minutes to me is like two seconds. So alarms and processes are helpful now that I know. But I have to stay on top of it. Having structure creates speed, freedom and Interestingly ￼ enough, that structure is translating in financial success. I no longer reach out for the coffee and I’m off and every day and inches off my waist too! You got this. If interior design isn’t working out for you, maybe the corporate world could be helpful. I struggled a bit weird rules , but I have found a way to navigate them and I understand that they keep me sane. 🍀 luck you got this!!!",5,2024-09-18 12:15:58,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/have-had-adhd-since-i-was-a-child-one-of-my-struggles-is-lateness-time-blindness-for-job-appointments-i-am-trying-to-work-on,1,274,48

Only you really know, I'm just trying to think what may cause it to understand how it may be prevented! But if the above could be the case, breathing exercises may help reduce the physical anxiety symptoms stimulants can cause (my stimulant medication definitely exacerbates the physical symptoms of my anxiety, personally), and something like stretching your shoulders and/or using a foam roller or trying yoga may help reduce that tension.

ADHD,Other,Authoran Associate Consultant,a year,I’ve been seeing a psychologist for a few weeks and I just get the sense that she doesn’t really get the daily struggles. I’m also struggling to find medicine and a dose that works and she smugly suggested that the medicines haven’t been working because I’m dealing with depression instead of adhd. We all know adhd and depression are often comorbidities which she should know already. How do you vet someone to make sure you are getting the best care? I almost feel like the best coach would be someone who struggles with it personally or has a spouse or child that struggles with it and they know first hand how debilitating it can feel sometimes and they have practical solutions to help instead of just telling you to keep a planner like you haven’t tried that before or sending things like sleep hygiene pdfs to read like I haven’t tried to stick to a routine before.,3,2024-09-18 12:37:02,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/has-anyone-found-an-adhd-coach-or-therapist-that-worked-with-you-one-on-one-to-build-healthy-coping-mechanisms-ive-been-seeing-a,1,280,31
ADHD,Other,an Unemployed Looking FOR Work 1,a year,"I would say find a therapist who’s goal oriented and not just doing CBT. A therapist that helps with you on achieving a specific goal.

You can also reach out to a career/professional development coach. They provide you with resources, checklists and teach you how to apply resources to your life. Working with mental health professionals who are action-oriented will definitely improve your outlook.

ADHD,Other,Slalom Consulting 1,8 months,"You need to look at severity and frequency of specific attention or hyperactivity symptoms that most would notice. Also, should be present in at least two major life activities, social and work for example. These days anyone with untreated moderate adhd could present as severe relative to gen pop. Moderate adhd creates some level of functional impairment. On my bad days, I space out a few times in meetings while in the middle of speaking trying to make an important point. On better days, I often miss important instructions when spoken to or DM’d. Clinically, I have moderate adhd.

Also, 2/3 of ADHDers have at least some other issue like depressive, mood, or anxiety disorder. So, if you have adhd and another disorder untreated then I could see such a person presenting as having more severe symptoms. My mood disorder makes my adhd terrible when not under control.

The “fixes” I did:
Build in a pre-meeting salutation/small talk. The weather or cool meme helps in this case.

Say hi to people (add extra time from point A to B when I was in the building for this).

Anything beyond that, needs additional situations where you were short or rude. And what the manager would say “should” have happened.

ADHD,Other,a Recruiting Coordinator Lead 1,8 months,"Hahaha yes!!! I get that feedback all the time 🤣🤣 something to note, I’m very open about my diagnosis at work. I was diagnosed later in life and at work I wear it like a badge of honor and don’t apologize for my diagnosis. I send my managers YouTube videos on ADHD to educate them on how to best support me as well. So my approach with my diagnosis may be too audacious for most people.

That being said, in my personal experience, I’ve been told that I need to use a softer approach when communicating with others. I’m very direct and to the point, and in the past very critical of things when they could be improved. I also lean more on the hyperactive side of ADHD so lack of impulse control and impatience is something I personally struggle with every day. To add on top of this, I’m also an ENTP, so I don’t shy away from a good ol’ debate.

Don’t take the feedback personally, instead look at it objectively. What has helped me is taking the time to learn about the psychology of different personality types and how they communicate in comparison to my communication style. I know it sounds like a lot of work but it will pay you dividends in the long run. You don’t have to be everyone’s friend at work, you need to be liked enough but most importantly respected, to cultivate strong relationships at work. At least that’s been my experience.

I would HIGHLY recommend that you either listen to the audiobooks (free with Spotify premium) or read the following two books:

The Courage to be Disliked
The Courage to be Happy

Once I started applying some of the principles in these books to my social interactions, things started to change for the better for me. If you think about it, all problems are interpersonal problems.

ADHD,Author,a CEO 1,9 months,The cure is to get yourself to a place of complete understanding until you totally surrender all things to a higher power than yourself . This means coming to terms with the fact that you do not have full control over life and your circumstances and that you never did. The behaviors come from a place of trying to control things that are out of your Hand’s . Coming to terms with Accepting that we are all vulnerable will cure the OCD ish thought’s! It’s not easy but it is achievable and it helps you to create a much healthier emotional state. You will become peaceful and no longer be reactive to yiur circumstances. For me it took a medical emergency that nearly ended my life to get there . I only wish it had happened sooner because I realized all of this after the fact and saw how I had wasted so much of my precious life worrying about things I could not control .

ADHD,Other,a Manager 1,6 months,"I was diagnosed at 8 years old and struggled like hell in school and work without medication all those years. I approached my doctor at 38 about meds because I was falling so behind at work that I was about to be on a PIP.
Ever since I found the right dose, I can function at work in the way I want to. There aren’t as many days that I can’t make my brain “go”.
I skip medicating on weekends or days off.

I understand the need for studies but asking if we’re using meds as a “crutch” is a red flag to me. I struggled for decades when I could have been excelling at the same level as my peers.

Would you ask someone with diabetes if their insulin medication is a crutch?",2,2024-09-18 12:39:15,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/do-you-think-adhd-meds-are-being-over-prescribed-are-we-using-meds-as-a-crutch-are-we-giving-in-to-societies-expectations,1,287,92
ADHD,Author,Authora Chief Executive Officer,6 months,"Not at all. I don’t doubt your diagnosis or need for meds.

I am curious why did you go without meds as a child?

I’m old. DSM clarified the ADHD diagnosis the year I graduated from high school, I was finally diagnosed a few years later and later went on meds the first time. Like you I struggled a lot without meds. Ritalin helped. But adderall was like a miracle drug for me. (I now only take it as needed because I have personal concerns about long term health effects)

So given that 75% of college students admit to trying meds at least once to get them through - the question I have is do you feel that it can be used as a performance enhancer for some?

And do you think some of those 75% have come to assume that being on adderall is what we’re all supposed to feel like?

Americans are 8x as likely to be diagnosed as our Western European counterparts. And US is a hustle culture

But it’s not just a disease, it’s a different kind of brain with its own pros and cons. When I’m not on meds, I do so much, in a very unorganized or “unproductive” way but I can be happy. I do mediocre art, I am witty and personable in social settings, I feel like life flows through me very naturally. On meds I get shit done but I do feel like if I had a job which was more suitable for my intelligence (which I think is more creative/emotional), then I really have no need for meds.

ADHD,Other,a Staff Software Engineer 1,a year,"First, cut it out with the self-deprecating language. Having ADHD doesn't make you ""dumb"" any more than Parkinson's or whatever makes someone ""lazy"". It's unhelpful to think/talk about yourself that way.

There are a variety of treatment/management options that many people with ADHD find helpful, ranging from medication to therapy or environment modification.

(Puzzles, hiking, swimming, crocheting, crafting, social media building…. Have fun!) if you can believe it. My education is in Corporate and Organizational Communication with Matketing (BA) and Organizational Communication graduate certificate and my master degree is in Public Administration. (MPA) I was in the corporate world for years, and was pushed to burn out fast. I now train dogs and work for myself. I tell people about my corky ways and they love me for who I am. If they don’t want me… all of me, no worries, they aren’t my people! I have been diagnosed with ADHD since I was 5, extremely rare for a girl. But only once I turned 40 and Tik Tok blew up did I really know what ADHD meant. It is mind boggling to me that I have walked around this world thinking I am less because of ADHD. Only because no one understood it. Now I know why I do the things I do. I understand why my brain works the way it does. Knowledge is power! (Sorry long response, did not spell check or check grammar, I got to go to bed! Just message me if you need anymore insight!)

Did any of them specialize in ADHD? If not, I would screen a new therapist that does and tell them you need help with a specific trauma.

Therapists are paid to listen to you and talk through what you want to work on. Your the one guiding the session and what’s discussed. You need to articulate what you want to work on and they need to help give you tools to help you cope. Healing through something like this will take time.","3

2. If you can force yourself for a few days in a row, set an alarm to wake yourself just before dawn. From wherever it's comfortable, watch the sunrise. The blue spectrum of a natural sunrises light activates specific reactions through your retinas to your brain, which help set your body's natural melatonin clock. (That's why blue light in the evenings messes us up.) In the evening, you should start feeling tired and ready to sleep at a more reasonable hour.

I want you to know because I care about you and if I’m late or not responding to a text it’s not about ignoring you or being disrespectful.

Separation between my work and living spaces is paramount. I have a separate office now, but before my desk was never in my bedroom and visually separated (think a curtain/partition) from the rest of my living area.

Getting dressed (doesn’t have to be fancy, just something comfortable and not lounge clothes) helps me. Wearing shoes gets me to focus for some reason. I can focus so well while I’m wearing sneakers at my standing desk.

Figure out what your distractions are and use them as rewards. I set a timer for 30 minutes during which I can’t look at my phone. 30 minutes of work gets me 5 minutes of a fun activity.

If you get stuck, go outside for a walk and don’t bring any electronics. Look at the trees and the sky. You want to limit your exposure to the things that stimulate you (social media) during the day so your work comparatively seems more stimulating.

If you’re really stuck, sit down and stare at a wall. I’m being 100% serious.

I think it’s info addiction. Whether it’s the dopamine hits from short videos, the anonymous engagement on platforms like this and Reddit, online dating - I mean swiping - , texting instead of talking to people.

We’ve lost our need to remember anything. We don’t memorize phone numbers, addresses, how to get places, the train schedule, the radio frequency, what’s on our shopping list.

We also don’t need to retain basic information like what time will my spouse be home for dinner, when do I take my kid to practice.

Finally while we’re probably smarter than ever because we consume so much information all the time, our brain just never gets a break. I can’t even go for a walk in the woods without wanting to look up every unfamiliar plant, or listen to the next podcast.

I’m so so guilty of all of this but I’m admittedly addicted, and rely on all the functionality to “succeed”.",10,2024-09-18 12:51:19,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/ive-seen-so-many-positive-effects-of-taking-adhd-medication-for-the-past-1-5-years-however-while-my-mind-is-a-less-hectic-more,1,318,257

ADHD,Other,a Business Analyst 1,3 months,"That’s the case in many big tech consulting firms, I’d recommend looking into mentorship programs or finding a mentor in the same industry or a desired industry of your liking.

Discuss and evaluate your strengths and weaknesses and what kind of upskilling or projects can you do you in an area you’re interested in (ADHD brains love novelty and work with with hyper focus on areas of interest).

Map out where you are and where you want to go next. A gap assessment essentially, see how you can break down this goal realistically. E.g. would you want to pivot into an industry role, a boutique consulting firm or another large rival consulting firm or even become a contractor etc.

Quarterly targets (in regards to upskilling, demonstrating certain skills in projects/community of practice, volunteer/personal projects, mentoring etc.) over yearly targets with a line manager or a mentor/peer to discuss progress, ADHD brains work better with short deadlines.

Opportunities can also come in the form of referrals from past colleagues, school/college peers, mentors etc. - closed mouths don’t get fed so no harm in asking around n being proactive even if it means cold calls/emails to recruiters/HR at your target firm’s industry.

You can either find a ‘buddy’ or a peer in the company you like to hold you accountable and do weekly check ins to work on your weekly tasks n explore what areas you’d like to develop in. Many people in consulting are masking just like you so please keep that in mind!

ADHD,Author,Accenture 1,3 months,"Sorry to hear that OP, fellow AuDHDer recently diagnosed. In my experience, I have always been known as the problem solver, the go-to person for any question (even on topics not directly linked to my core responsibilities). This is because I constantly need new things or I get bored, and if my supervisor didn’t give it to me I would just come up with ways to “fix things”. I have always worked with remote teams, so I could set up my own structure, aka: blocking time in my calendar to remember myseld do stuff (or even have lunch, helped when I was hyperfocusing) , categorizing emails and to-dos so I would set priorities, asking lots of questions to the point of annoying people. Always got great feedback and DA/TP in talent discussions, but instead of a promotion I got a burnout. And I have been laid off because my role moved to India. I do still think Consulting could be the right career path for me because there is always something new and I like solving problems, but I do also fear burning out again… But it’s a lonely journey, even the most empathetic supervisor will only care about themselves, and they’ll keep you where you are if you are “too good” at your job vs promoting you and needing to find your replacement… A coach or a mentor could help with advice and feedback in a safe space.

Tell them that you need to be in a burn-free bed and make sure it’s warm when you get in. Tan for 5-7 minutes (cover your face for half of the time with a towel. Tanning long term? No way. But as the most effective intervention used to treat SAD, it also begins to work immediately. Continued exposure such as daily for same time limit for three days, or every other day is something for you to decide….but please do not fear!!! Your main worry : sunburn. The staff will tell you by looking at you how long to go each day — they DON’T EVER WANT YOU TO BURN. Please give this a shot TODAY.

My reccomendation is the same as above, be honest and upfront about any medications you are on. The lab tech can mark that off if there is a potential flag.

ADHD,Other,an Associate 1,20d,"I keep a really detailed task list with check boxes that covers my whole day and then has sections for each day this week and the following week. And then a list to the side that just says “put somewhere” where I dump things that I don’t know when I will complete yet. Everything gets slotted to a day and if it doesn’t happen it gets reallocated to another day. And then I have lots of outlook reminders and block off time to complete particularly time intensive tasks. The block may need to move as meetings arise but it’s a visual reminder that I need to reserve time for it and then I can shift it to accommodate other obligations without totally forgetting about it.

For a while I used a pomodoro timer or parallel working YouTube videos (there’s a specific term I’m forgetting right now, but basically it’s another person working with calm background noise and they build the pomodoro timer into the video). I still go back to that when I’m struggling to stay on task.","1

3- as much as possible, bring in elements of my normal routine. I walk my dog every morning before work at home, and I find it helps me to start the day with a walk or other exercise before getting ready for work.

For organization, when I travel a lot, I keep a toiletry bag full all the time and a fairly simple wardrobe. I also have duplicate chargers for travel and mostly just keep things minimal because the fewer things I have the less I need to keep track of.

ADHD,Other,an Associate 3,6 months,"I’m not sure of the exact terminology (and I don’t take adderall) and there are so many variations of each medication, so you’ll probably have to ask you’re doctor there. I’d also recommend keeping the dose as small as possible to give you the boost that you need. I could probably use a much higher dose, but I have to balance it with the anxiety, so I’ve settled on a dose that gives me the boost I need while not ramping up anxiety too badly. Some days focus/anxiety is better than others. On a day where focus is bad but anxiety isn’t, I might skip the anxiety meds and take a little extra adhd meds.

ADHD,Author,a Senior Data Scientist 1,a day,"First sorry to hear that. I have been experiencing similar issues for a long time but we may come from different places.

I recently got evaluated for adhd and turns out I don’t have it. My problem comes more from depression. The thing is, do you know you have adhd or not? That’s something you have since childhood, otherwise you won’t get it when you are in adulthood. So if you haven’t, I strongly recommend you have the evaluation done first, then see whether it’s actually adhd or something else. Then you can have a better treatment plan with your doctor and therapist.

For my example, I don’t have adhd but suffering from depression. It does very similar things to me as what you described. I have nearly zero reading comprehension capability, if your post is longer I won’t be able to read it at all. What I’m trying to say is you really need the diagnosis first.

Please try to get the evaluation done and talk with your doctor. Wish you get better soon.

ADHD,Other,a Manager 1,9d,"TL:DR; Establish work “zones” and have a habit that ends your work day officially.

I’m not sure how much of this will apply, but first thing I worked on was establishing work boundaries. I don’t answer work messages outside my business hours unless it’s absolutely necessary. I took work apps off my phone where possible (email and teams).

I also established “work zone” habits - habits I do every day when work is done.

I work from home, so I have an established “work zone”, which is a bedroom I turned into an office. If you can’t turn a room into the “office”, you could designate a space in a room with its own desk and area rug (even if the rug is just the size of the desk and chair).
If you work away from home, use your commute home to start thinking about the first things to do when you get home (make grocery list, throw some laundry in the washer, fix leaky pipe, etc.)

I make myself a mocktail (alcohol free cocktail) when I’m officially “done” with work each day and sit on my porch and people watch for 5 mins. It helps declutter my mind. On cold days, I stand in my kitchen and listen to some music for 5 mins while I just zone out.

Then I go do home things (change out of work clothes, do something related to home that’s on my mind, etc.).

It’s not perfect and doesn’t always work but it’s helped cut down on how much I talk about work to my husband",,2024-09-18 13:25:02,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/im-a-supermarket-store-manager-i-have-7-department-managers-80-staff-and-sales-20mil-a-year-i-really-struggle-staying-consistent,1,645,68

ADHD,Other,an Attorney 1,8 months,"Yes I did over 2,200 hours last year as my firm changed its billable hours requirements 6 months after I started here.

It’s difficult even for perfectly healthy people. I was cranky and irritable, sad, and tired all the time and started getting feedback about typos. I’m still burned out though I’ve barely worked any hours since January 1.

Billing 8 hours isn’t the difficulty. You get used to it. 40 hours isn’t bad. It’s that sometimes there’s work, so you can space out your hours like that, and other times you may have a bunch of 6 hour days and some 13 billable hour days. I did it, but I really had no life. All I did was work. No friends. Didn’t go much of anywhere. All I wanted to do was sleep on my days off.

Unless they’re paying you a whole lot of money or there’s something there that can help your future goals, I recommend getting out and going somewhere with a more humane hours requirement l. I hope I don’t take years of my life doing that.

I was kind of farmed and taken advantage of for 13 years (first 3 permatemp) because I didn’t know what I was other than high-performing. I never pushed for the salary others were making or even credit for all of my work. My employers both laid me off while on leave - COWARDS. I had to go on leave for exhaustion more than once. Employers do not always share our tendency toward loyalty. They are often aware of how to manipulate us. Try not to take it personally. It is not a shortcoming on our part. Just a different connection. If you are like me, you love the code. Some people like the money they make from our passions too.

Not all anyone, of course, but greed and exploitation seem a little more free and easy these days, unfortunately.

I’m sorry this happened to you. But nothing is *wrong* with you. We are all born perfect, with our own strengths and weaknesses. Nature decides. We just have to roll with the hand we are dealt.

I was diagnosed with ADHD in my 30s, and it looks like I went for the high score on self-tests for ASD just a few months back (nearly 20 years later - let’s say I missed some jokes over the years). We all had to adapt to things kids today are lucky to get help with (if they can even get in for diagnosis). A menagerie of coping mechanisms. Considering we were often misunderstood and even punished because of neurodiversity, the fact that we can find cool work we are good at and each other for support, we are doing okay….mostly.",,2024-09-18 18:21:47,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/known-something-was-wrong-with-me-as-far-back-as-i-can-remember-some-exceptional-abilities-stem-but-serious-deficits,1,711,64

ADHD,Author,a Project Leader 1,a year,"Since both adhd and autism are both spectrums - Would it help to practice certain scenarios to build the muscle memory or steps to reach certification? Friends/family might like being a test subject to help you diffuse.

Are there small things that you might be able to speed up (instead of 50 seconds to do, so it in 45 seconds?) cumulative time savings could make you faster.

When I run my test center - I tell the students to enjoy taking their tests. Because if you go in thinking horrible thoughts, it slows down your thinking and your scores show it. If you enjoy the process -it helps you to relax enough to focus at the task right now and get it done quickly.

ADHD,Other,a Community Director 1,5 months,"Get a calendar that is easy for you to carry in and out of the office if you don’t have a desk that locks and you’re not the only one that has a key. Then document every. single. day. Even if it is uneventful. She’s on vacation? Write, supervisor on vacation. If she misses a meeting write it down on the day and what time she was supposed to be there. Did she make an off the cuff remark that could be or was insulting to you? Note the time, then when she leaves, Write it down on the day and remember to write it verbatim in “quotes” what she said. Don’t think it will be a one time thing, I was giving my boss the benefit of the doubt and it turned into a nasty habit even when I told her after her 3rd outburst it was unacceptable, unprofessional, and I didn’t deserve to be talked to in that manner. Unfortunately I didn’t start documentation right away. I will never do that again. Also don’t do it on their company computer. If you can get examples and print them off, etc., then do that and place some in the calendar with your notes. Also if you have your policies and can find the policies violation, I would print that off and put that in there as well. The lack of training is on her, but from my experience, people that will dismiss company policy, improperly train new hires, Etc. will also be the kind of person to throw the new person under the bus when they questioned about why it wasn’t done. You will need to have all of your documentation notes as to what she told you and why she couldn’t be there to train you ready to go. When you can ask to please be reassigned to somebody who would be willing to train you ( and supervise you from now on to prevent retaliation) the proper way so that you can do your job to the best of your ability. Explain how you want to work with the company, you’re excited to be there, and are ready to learn and grow with them. I just went through something very similar, I was very excited about the position. I loved my job, where I was at, and the entire organization I was working for. I just had one person who happened to be directly above me and was in charge of my three month on boarding, I had two days. It was chaos. I’m sorry to hear that other people are going through similar situations, but there is a way to protect yourself and get the proper training that you deserve to have.

ADHD,Other,an Architect 1,2 months,"I got an ADHD diagnosis when I was in middle school, and I was medicated for quite a long time. But to be honest I think the medication did more harm than good (I don't think they're giving out adderral like they used to, but be careful if they're trying to get on a stimulant). I think life after medication has been much calmer for me (ironic I know). I think the main thing I notice about being an architect with ADHD is that I just have to work extra hard to finish projects. I am notorious for starting a million projects and not completing any of them.

You don't mention a timeline for the temp thing. I can tell you that we are more sensitive to it than men are because of our core temp.

So I'm more aware of the cold and want to avoid it.

As to the phone thing...it's just an easy distraction when you're bored. I know I make a conscious effort to ignore my phone when I'm out with friends but not everyone is as considerate.

ADHD,Author,Authora Consultant,7 months,When I’m on the apps and juggling multiple potentials I can’t keep conversations straight with the right dates. Eg: was he the one that told me he had a bad day? Did I already tell this one about my recent move or was that someone else? Was this the one who said he liked to go out dancing? I think I navigate it pretty well for the most part by asking kindly (“did I tell you that I recently moved or was that *my friend* I was talking to?”) but it’s definitely tripped me up in the past.,3,2024-09-17 20:55:40,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/is-it-too-soon-after-v-day-to-talk-adhd-and-dating-how-does-it-or-has-it-impacted-your-ability-to-date-or-hold-down-a-relationship,1,352,15

ADHD,Author,a Consultant 1,7 months,"Until my current partner, every single person I dated eventually blamed me for my disability actually disabling me.

ADHD,Other,an Analyst 1,4 months,"So, be aware of a couple things here.

ADHD is considered a neurodivergent condition, which is a protected characteristics under UK law. This means functionally that you have explicit protection in the eyes of the law against unfair dismissal, defence for inappropriate performance reviews, and access to REASONABLE accommodation for your job.

What reasonable means, is unfortunately not clearly defined as it is thought of as job dependent. I think a reasonable benefit is to ask for coaching support for prioritisation help (which many large corporates are happy to provide).

What DOESNT work well in the current system is a) the amount of administrative work it places on someone with an attention disorder if they ask to see paperwork and b) the fact that you may never be aware you have been discriminated against.

What I have personally seen done, is to disclose it once an employee; in those circumstances corporates like it because it pass their diversity statistics, and you've already ""proven"" yourself by passing the interview so people are likely to receive the news fairly well depending on what accomodation you ask for.

Essentially, I argue that once you are in the organisation everyone makes a Richard Branson joke then forgets about it. If you are mid recruiting, that's when you are most at risk of bias so I wouldn't mention it unless the corporate is explicitly supportive (and has openly neurodiverse leadership). It's a tricky one.","2

ADHD,Other,Deloitte 1,a year,"Look for an adult ADHD specialist. If you’re only getting assessed as an adult, there’s a good chance there were extenuating circumstances that prevented you from getting help as a child (eg traumatic or abusive childhood, being female or an ethnic minority, being gifted academically, developing exceptional masking skills for a million possible reasons etc), so you’ll want someone who knows what to look for beyond the obvious signs - and who won’t just say ‘well you did well in school so here’s some xanax’.

Also highly recommend checking out How To ADHD on Instagram. Her research is top-notch and way more current than what most doctors will know about (she was literally top of the list of resources my doctor gave me after diagnosing me).

Also, I’m not sure what culture you’re from, but off the top of my head, I know Black Girl Lost Keys has some great content about being Black and ADHD and I’ve recently started following adhdjaye on IG who talks a bit about being ADHD and Asian. The ADHD community could definitely use some more diverse representation but we are getting there slowly but surely so have a look around (and see who those people follow) and you should hopefully be able to find someone who can speak more closely to your experience.

ADHD,Other,Deloitte 1,a year,"Also remember, getting a diagnosis doesn’t mean you have to take meds. It took me about 9 months after diagnosis before I decided to try them. I’m really glad I did because they were life changing for me (after I found the right meds at the right dose) but they aren’t for everyone and it’s completely up to you whether you want to start/stop/continue them. Learning how my brain and nervous system work and adapting my lifestyle to suit them instead of striving for someone else’s perfect has also been life changing and it’s completely valid to stick with that if that’s what works for you.

ADHD,Other,a RN 1,9 months,"Smoking weed and working as an RN aren't compatible. You'll be forced to choose.

The issue surrounding weed is...you can smoke or consume it days earlier and test positive today. So did you really smoke days ago or are you at work high? Your guess is as good as your employer. An employer is also not bound to honor a law legalizing marijuana ...they don't have to hire you and likely won't if you are open about your use. Your use opens you personally to being a target of lawsuit and an employee easily offered up by your employer if something ever goes wrong. Board of nursing also asks if you take anything that can possibly impair your judgement...nurses have to declare narcotic use medications, sometimes antipsychotics or anxiety meds.

ADHD,Other,Authoran Analyst,3 months,"As I went through college, I stayed off meds and same for my early career. I got to a point where I wanted to try something because I was having a real mental health crisis and felt like my ADHD was really at the core of it.

Needless to say, medications have come a long way and there are a lot more options now and ADHD. My physiatrist recommended Wellbutrin and I’ve been on it for a few weeks, I think it’s really helping me with the lifestyle pieces (starting task, less dopamine seeking in food and screens) but I don’t necessarily feel like it’s helping my focus yet. I generally feel like I have good habits around work and life but as we know, this can only do so much.

Does anyone supplement their Wellbutrin with something else? Looking for people’s general experience with Wellbutrin as well, maybe I haven’t given it enough time as it can take a bit to kick in.",7,2024-09-17 21:49:14,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/i-was-diagnosed-at-a-very-young-age-with-adhd-at-which-point-i-tried-medication-and-my-parents-opted-to-take-me-off-of-it-because-it,1,375,26
ADHD,Other,Accenture 1,3 months,"I've been on Wellbutrin for about six months now. I started at a low dose and slowly increased it until I felt it was working for my ADHD. The only side effect I experienced was dry mouth, but that went away as I got used to the medication. It's been a life changer for me. Not only can I focus and get work done without having to wait until the last minute so that I can use the stress to hyper-focus, but I also feel much more emotionally stable. It turns out the anxiety and depression I've lived with for the majority of my life were symptoms of undiagnosed ADHD. Explains why all the therapy and everything I've been trying for years didn't help. I don't supplement Wellbutrin with anything since it works so well for me, but it did take about a month to feel the effects.","1

ADHD,Other,a Senior Counsel 1,2 months,"Sure! And sorry in advance for the novel:

So from my experience, most of my scholastic and professional grief came from an inability to do things the way everyone else did. I was smart and competent, but just couldn’t follow the system that worked for everyone else. Teachers, counselors, parents, and even I also surmised the problem must be me. Because the system was designed to be simple, effective, and get results. E.g. it was a tree with an easy to follow climbing path, with each branch within reach of a standard monkey arm. But I’m a fish.
And no one cares HOW I do it, so long as I get things done.

So, I threw out everything I had been told about the way to do things and leaned into my particular strengths and weaknesses. My starting point was the premise that 87% of the difficulties were foreseeable problems and my ultimate goal is to prevent them.

I really like puzzles and sussing out inefficiencies and making new protocols: I’ll spend 50 hours finding a way to make a 1 hr task doable in 20 minutes, but getting motivated to do that actual task may be harder. But even if small admin matters are the death of me and I hate doing them and won’t do them, making them simple lets me offloaded that stuff to support staff.

Structure feels like prison, but is needed to keep me on track. If I allow myself to get distracted by every new email, it’ll kill my productivity (because “new” is fun and exciting to my brain). So I break my day up into cycles:
1) Check email putting items on a to do list, 2) knock out 5 min tasks too small to put on a to do list (including sending follow ups to people, so that way I can hit someone 2-3x a day if need be), 3) a working session, 4) miscellaneous. And repeat 4-5 times a day. I build in time for fire drills, if they don’t arise then I get a head start on other matters. The structure helps ensure when a random hyper focus session hits that it’s productive. Also by doing things in batches I avoid lost productive from task switching. Every email I respond to within 1 business days, probably 90%+ of my emails don’t need a response before then, so I don’t let my email rule my day.

Final deadlines don’t work well for me for anything that takes more than an hour to do. So I have mini deadlines for each component of the task. Mini deadlines allow me to put some time in between sections which allows me to see things with fresh eyes. Breaking it up also keeps me from wasting time “over-writing” something. It also helps me see a “cash flow” of my time, I’d rather work an extra hour M-Th than have to pull an all nighter on Thursday to meet a Friday morning deadline. It’s also clutch for when you’ve delegated things to support staff, you can see time crunches they’re oblivious to. Once a week we have a calendar meeting looking at all deadlines due this week and the next 2, and we restructure things as needed. Because I need to get everything done, AND want to average 8 hours a day, not 6 one day then 12 the next. I treat work like being a short order cook, I got lots of burners going because I need a bunch of dishes to hit the table at once…

Lastly, on to do lists, my daily to do list has things due at different times. AM, noon, afternoon, COB, EOD. This helps trigger “deadline mode” and give me a surge of adrenaline to hit deadlines. My most sacred rule beyond respond within 24 hours, is when I say I’ll have something by “X” there is nothing that can make me miss that deadline. So I give inflated deadlines, and send completed work before its due, and I may even schedule an email to send it super early or late in the day (which makes me look like I’m working around the clock, because appearances are important and pre planning helps down the line when someone has an urgent task, I don’t want them thinking I’m just sitting around waiting for them to give me something, harder to get them to comply with my intake process).

My brain hates reinventing the wheel. So I try to automate things as best I can. As in-house counsel I get the same 10 questions all the time. So I built custom signatures in outlook so I can respond in 1 click with a template response. And processing certain tasks has been scheduled for a set time. E.g. I review NDA’s at 4pm every day and I knock them all out, whether it takes me 5 min or an hour. No task switching.

I always have Word open, so I made custom AutoCorrects to build checklists for many types of task. (Information needs to be at my fingertips, if I need to go digging for multiple files to complete something, my brain may say “ugh that’s so much work.”) E.g. when I type in “NDA$” it spits out the list of 5 concepts I care about when reviewing an NDA. If I typed in “NDA1$” it would give me exact verbiage for concept #1 I can copy/paste into whatever doc I’m working on.
Similarly, whenever I come up with a new clever solution I spend time to document it so I can quickly find it again.

My most drastic approach has been to externalize my ADHD into what I call my “goblin brain.” I’m not a lazy POS, my co-pilot is. I need his sign off to do anything. He cannot be reasoned with and attempts to do so just derail me, but he is egotistical and can be manipulated (he’s the head and I’m the neck). Me: “Hey we need to do this thing it’s really important”
Goblin: “it is isn’t it? Good on you for recognizing that, you’re so smart!”
Me: “thanks I am!”
*continues doing nothing*

So I manipulate his weaknesses. If I say let’s put away laundry, he’ll say let’s do it later and I won’t win that. So, I say “ok, but I’m going to put away just this one shirt, it’s my favorite and I don’t want it to get wrinkled.” Which is reasonable and he says sure. But once I do that, he says “well while we’re here, may as well just finish it.” Because once I get momentum it’s a lot easier to finish a task.

Another good one is when I have something I really should do but I can technically put it off. “Oh I’m gonna head out a little early but I’ll do it when I get home.” No I won’t. I’ll get home and say “ah I can do it tomorrow.” It’s Charlie Brown being tricked by Lucy with the football. And the cycle will repeat until it’s way past due, because I’ve now gotten into a cycle of procrastination on this task, and for some reason it’s 2x as hard to actually do it (maybe it’s the shame?) So to head that off at the pass, whenever I say “oh I’ll do it later” I yell at myself “bitch no you won’t, sit your ass down and do it and then you can go home!” And I sigh, realize I’m right and just do it.

More helpful bits on doing something I don’t want to: just open the word doc. If I still lack motivation, minimize everything else and just stare at the word doc and don’t allow myself to day dream. Eventually I’ll get so bored that work will be more stimulating.

I take frequent breaks, but they’re scheduled and timed. Outside those windows I don’t open my browser or phone, because I’ll get distracted with something new/interesting. In fact, every time I open my browser or pick up my cellphone I’ll quietly say aloud “oh ok so we’re not going to do any work right now eh?” There’s something about an auditory trigger that makes me more mindful about those time wasters.

Monday is crazy, so best to be in office those days and get in 30 min earlier so I can complete my email/intake cycles before needing to jump on a fire drill.

I have a running list at the bottom of my to do list of “when I have time” improvements. That way when there’s a lull I can keep working. If I lose momentum (particularly between 2-3pm) I’m toast. So redlining a long contract is a good task to start at 1.

Because I’m not a monkey, I need to ensure my fish strategies don’t get me in hot water with my boss, and help me be a good employee and take work off their plate.

So every week at the same day/time I send a summary email update of every item I’m working on, noting deadlines, what items need feedback, etc. And because I’d be embarrassed if there wasn’t any progress on an item, it provides incentive to move everything forward. I also can’t fudge any statuses, because I’ve asked my boss for an accommodation- to pick an item at random and ask me to email it ASAP as it is. The summary is also clutch because if they randomly ping me for an update it takes me 5 seconds to forward the email and I keep my momentum.

That summary email also forms the agenda for weekly one on ones with my boss. I get to lay out items for their feedback, my proposed solution (including exact verbiage) and rationale, and a ticking clock that I’m going to execute unless they tell me otherwise by Y date. It’s also useful because it helps document approvals, which can sometimes be squishy (were they approving this concept, or this exact verbiage addressing this concept?)

My escalations to stakeholders follow this same pattern. They’re not going to read the doc. So I submit a chart and include the exact verbiage I’m seeking approval on. This helps with lazier folks who won’t redline and prevents them throwing me under the bus when we accept non-standard terms.

Similarly to avoid foreseeable fire drills and getting hosed, I’m deeply integrated with my sales teams. I want to know what’s coming down the pipeline so I can allocate resources (and prevent them sandbagging me at the last minute, or blaming Legal for a bad deal not closing). If someone says this is mission critical and happening this quarter but nothing has been sent to me, you can bet I’m going to inquire the next meeting with the sales brass. Because I cannot force other depts to abide by my timelines, but the business leaders can force their minions to abide. And if I need to stop working on A’s project (which was timely submitted) to deal with B’s project (which became a fire drill due to mismanagement), I want to make sure I take no blame and don’t work 12 hour days. I’m a limited resource after all and just deploy where the business needs me. I ask business leaders which to prioritize, and when I get told to work on B, I know A will raise hell in their org for getting back burnered (with no backlash to me).","3

So I built custom signatures in outlook so I can respond in 1 click with a template response. And processing certain tasks has been scheduled for a set time. E.g. I review NDA’s at 4pm every day and I knock them all out, whether it takes me 5 min or an hour. No task switching.

I always have Word open, so I made custom AutoCorrects to build checklists for many types of task. (Information needs to be at my fingertips, if I need to go digging for multiple files to complete something, my brain may say “ugh that’s so much work.”) E.g. when I type in “NDA$” it spits out the list of 5 concepts I care about when reviewing an NDA. If I typed in “NDA1$” it would give me exact verbiage for concept #1 I can copy/paste into whatever doc I’m working on.
Similarly, whenever I come up with a new clever solution I spend time to document it so I can quickly find it again.

My most drastic approach has been to externalize my ADHD into what I call my “goblin brain.” I’m not a lazy POS, my co-pilot is. I need his sign off to do anything. He cannot be reasoned with and attempts to do so just derail me, but he is egotistical and can be manipulated (he’s the head and I’m the neck). Me: “Hey we need to do this thing it’s really important”
Goblin: “it is isn’t it? Good on you for recognizing that, you’re so smart!”
Me: “thanks I am!”
*continues doing nothing*

So I manipulate his weaknesses. If I say let’s put away laundry, he’ll say let’s do it later and I won’t win that. So, I say “ok, but I’m going to put away just this one shirt, it’s my favorite and I don’t want it to get wrinkled.” Which is reasonable and he says sure. But once I do that, he says “well while we’re here, may as well just finish it.” Because once I get momentum it’s a lot easier to finish a task.

Another good one is when I have something I really should do but I can technically put it off. “Oh I’m gonna head out a little early but I’ll do it when I get home.” No I won’t. I’ll get home and say “ah I can do it tomorrow.” It’s Charlie Brown being tricked by Lucy with the football. And the cycle will repeat until it’s way past due, because I’ve now gotten into a cycle of procrastination on this task, and for some reason it’s 2x as hard to actually do it (maybe it’s the shame?) So to head that off at the pass, whenever I say “oh I’ll do it later” I yell at myself “bitch no you won’t, sit your ass down and do it and then you can go home!” And I sigh, realize I’m right and just do it.

More helpful bits on doing something I don’t want to: just open the word doc. If I still lack motivation, minimize everything else and just stare at the word doc and don’t allow myself to day dream. Eventually I’ll get so bored that work will be more stimulating.

I take frequent breaks, but they’re scheduled and timed. Outside those windows I don’t open my browser or phone, because I’ll get distracted with something new/interesting. In fact, every time I open my browser or pick up my cellphone I’ll quietly say aloud “oh ok so we’re not going to do any work right now eh?” There’s something about an auditory trigger that makes me more mindful about those time wasters.

Monday is crazy, so best to be in office those days and get in 30 min earlier so I can complete my email/intake cycles before needing to jump on a fire drill.

I have a running list at the bottom of my to do list of “when I have time” improvements. That way when there’s a lull I can keep working. If I lose momentum (particularly between 2-3pm) I’m toast. So redlining a long contract is a good task to start at 1.

Because I’m not a monkey, I need to ensure my fish strategies don’t get me in hot water with my boss, and help me be a good employee and take work off their plate.

So every week at the same day/time I send a summary email update of every item I’m working on, noting deadlines, what items need feedback, etc. And because I’d be embarrassed if there wasn’t any progress on an item, it provides incentive to move everything forward. I also can’t fudge any statuses, because I’ve asked my boss for an accommodation- to pick an item at random and ask me to email it ASAP as it is. The summary is also clutch because if they randomly ping me for an update it takes me 5 seconds to forward the email and I keep my momentum.

That summary email also forms the agenda for weekly one on ones with my boss. I get to lay out items for their feedback, my proposed solution (including exact verbiage) and rationale, and a ticking clock that I’m going to execute unless they tell me otherwise by Y date. It’s also useful because it helps document approvals, which can sometimes be squishy (were they approving this concept, or this exact verbiage addressing this concept?)

My escalations to stakeholders follow this same pattern. They’re not going to read the doc. So I submit a chart and include the exact verbiage I’m seeking approval on. This helps with lazier folks who won’t redline and prevents them throwing me under the bus when we accept non-standard terms.

Similarly to avoid foreseeable fire drills and getting hosed, I’m deeply integrated with my sales teams. I want to know what’s coming down the pipeline so I can allocate resources (and prevent them sandbagging me at the last minute, or blaming Legal for a bad deal not closing). If someone says this is mission critical and happening this quarter but nothing has been sent to me, you can bet I’m going to inquire the next meeting with the sales brass. Because I cannot force other depts to abide by my timelines, but the business leaders can force their minions to abide. And if I need to stop working on A’s project (which was timely submitted) to deal with B’s project (which became a fire drill due to mismanagement), I want to make sure I take no blame and don’t work 12 hour days. I’m a limited resource after all and just deploy where the business needs me. I ask business leaders which to prioritize, and when I get told to work on B, I know A will raise hell in their org for getting back burnered (with no backlash to me).",3,2024-09-17 21:49:49,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/granted-i-have-been-sleep-deprived-for-a-couple-of-days-but-i-am-experiencing-such-intense-burnout-i-feel-like-i-should-quit-my,1,377,49

ADHD,Other,a Chief Executive Officer 1,7 months,"Guided meditation podcasts are my go to. Via podcast or YouTube.

There are also podcasts specifically for sleep, one is called “sleep with me”, where a guy just rambles about nothing for hours. I heard about one where someone reads an ikea product catalog, and there are some dry bedtime stories.

If that doesn’t work, get out of bed, have a glass of milk or water and read a book in another room. This might help shift the mind - if not quiet it.

Last resort, just get up and get ready to go. If you’re ready early, get a nap in last minute. And avoid caffeine so you can also try to nap in flight.

Being frustrated or stressed about not sleeping the surefire way not to get sleep. Know that one night of lost sleep isn’t going to ruin your day.

I would focus on trying to understand what specific behaviours your colleague with ADHD shows that may be triggering this reaction, and work with them on developing mitigations or supports to deal with those.

ADHD,Other,"a Digital Communications, Healthcare Marketing 1",5 months,"Having been hired into many roles over my career, these types of tests are often standard in larger companies. It’s not necessary to answer all 50 questions to be selected to move on to the next interview round. I just completed one, answering only 33 of the 50 questions and was contacted to schedule the next interview round.

These types of assessments give the hiring team (and possibly your future manager) an idea of how you approach problem solving and critical thinking in your day-to-day functions and potentially stressful projects or deadlines.

As for any disability, yes, if you claim that, there must be reasonable accommodations. Each question has about 1:30 minutes to complete and there are free cognitive tests online that you can use to help prepare.

ADHD,Author,a Senior Digital Marketing Manager 1,5 months,"If you’re a large company and get 2,000+ applicants for every job posting, you have to screen them somehow. The ATS internal screening will only take you so far, with a large enough starting pool of applicants, you may still end up with a couple hundred applicants, even with strict screening. That’s why you give additional screening layers such as personality tests, aptitude tests, video interviews, etc. At each stage, candidates will be screened out and give you the ‘cream of the crop’.

Is it the most ethical way to hire? Maybe not. But businesses aren’t meant to be ethical, that’s capitalism for you. The process is doing exactly what it was designed for, being highly efficient at selecting the best candidates. Yes, people will get left out and it sucks when that happens.

I think one really recent change is that Vyvanse finally got (or is just about to get?) a generic version. The lack of which was a reason much fewer people here in the states got to try it previously (vs Adderall and Ritalin).

Also since he or she is just starting to try meds, might be worth trying out non-stimulant meds (Strattera, Qelbree etc) first.

ADHD,Author,an Analyst 1,a month,"There are some non stim options for kids including some patches you put on your skin (I know people who had great luck with that under 18 - for some reason not all drs will give this to adults). I was diagnosed very young and tried the med route (Adderall and Ritalin at various doses), it made me severely anxious even at the lowest dose so I went no medication until my late 20s (still on the journey of figuring out what works tbh). My parents basically felt like they couldn’t keep me on meds that were ruining me emotionally so they decided to take me off them (I was really too young to understand the situation and advocate for myself). So they tried other things including diet recommendations from my dr, brain training, CBT, and supplements. I have worked with a therapist for over 4 years now and she ultimately is the one who pushed me to pursue meds to support my work (less so life things) she is stunned at how well I function without meds compared to other clients with ADHD. I do wonder what about my life would be different with medication earlier, but nothing I can do about that now.

I have my theories that these meds were just too much for young bodies and brains, but not a dr. I’m not med shaming and I think you should explore your options and see what works, but these are some things that worked for me when meds were deemed not a good option by my parents. That said, there are tons of options on the market now that didn’t exist back then. I would do your own research, talk to their doctor about all the options and don’t just take a stimulant Rx as the solution (even if that’s ultimately where you land) you should be made aware of all the options available.

One thing that has helped me is keeping a bragging file about things that you have done at the company, your leadership experience and training /volunteering that you are doing.

Another thing would be to see if you can find a mentor/sponsor within the company - doesn’t have to be in your department org chart. This person can assist with coaching that your boss might not regularly do.

For example, right now I’m looking at potentially moving over to product. And I know some folks (networking) that work in product. So, I’ve set up coffee meetups with them to chat about their role and their experiences.

Another thing I’m currently thinking about doing is asking leaders in my area for their tips/tricks for getting things done at their level. It helps me understand how things work 1-2 levels above me.

ADHD,Author,a Regulatory Affairs Consultant 1,a year,"You don’t get promotions by just being good at your job. You need to actively voice a desire to move up and work towards new opportunities.

1) make sure you have routine 1:1 meetings scheduled with your boss. Always set an agenda for these meetings and always include your accomplishments for the week and what development actions your taking.
2) make sure you have no-annual development meetings with your manager scheduled. You set the agenda for this call too and use it as a mini-review where you ask for actionable feedback and create a growth plan together. You can voice your desire for a promotion in both the 1:1 and the development meetings.
3) Ask for skip level meetings where you can meet with your boss’s boss. I’ve used this time to seek mentorship, share ideas I’ve had for the department, and express my desire to grow within the department. All approaches have been well received.
4) To the best of your ability (this one’s hard for me because of ADHD but I still put in effort to do it) track your accomplishments. This makes it a lot easier to write your annual self evaluation if you have one and to talk about your accomplishments in the three meetings listed above. You can couple this step with writing an agenda for the 1:1 meeting, it’s sometimes easier to put those notes together and prep at the same time.

ADHD,Other,an Associate 1,a year,"Yeah. I break everything into micro tasks. I also have a daily checklist for my health / life related things (sometimes I even check off the basics, showering, eating meals, etc) and have added a mood chart into it (also have bipolar and bpd). While meds can/do help, it’s not always the case. Exercise every day is seriously key. My bf also has it, so he forces me even when I don’t want to. Lots of protein. Lowered carbs and fats. I take daily vitamins, vitamin d, magnesium, NAC, l theanine ashwaganda and alpha gpc.

Routines are seriously key. Understanding your limits of what you can’t do is huge. There are going to be bad days. Minimize your tasks those days. Use a mental health day or budget your time to break up PTO to protect yourself. Minimize scrolling…

ADHD,Author,a Corporate Counsel 1,6 months,"I use it and love it. It removes the added stress of trying to decided what to do next. I prioritize my tasks, set deadline and it decides for me. I have not struggled to meet a deadline since. Features I particularly like:

-you can set hard or soft deadlines, so if a draft is due on a particular day, it knows to not shift that work beyond that specific deadline. I use hard/soft deadlines in combo with the ability to rate tasks by priority

- tagging. I tag certain tasks as “follow up” so they don’t fall off my radar.

- calendar integration so it doesn’t schedule a work block during a meeting

- “blocked by” feature. If there is a task that I can’t start until I finish another task first it won’t schedule the second task until I mark the first one as complete

- if you have too many things if the same priority and similar deadlines it will alert you so you can review the tasks and decide whether you can shift a deadline or change task priority

- split up workspaces so I can have my work tasks populate separately from personal tasks during specified time frames (eg work hours, weekends, etc)

- Ability to set recurring tasks (eg a weekly report, etc)

- Large tasks (eg write Motion for SJ) are automatically broken down into smaller bits of time. So it automatically spreads the work over multiple days

Features that need work:

- only integrates with Microsoft and Google calendars. I got around this by integrating iCal when I used it to Gcal ans then Gcal to Motion

-annoying to set up initially

-no color coding capability although I hear they’re developing it as a feature

-the mobile app is clunky, although continually improving. It’s much better than when I first started using Motion",2,2024-09-17 22:09:16,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/has-anyone-tried-the-motion-app-my-entire-instagram-feed-is-adhd-ads-and-thats-one-that-comes-up-a-lot-im-honestly-desperate-for,1,420,307

ADHD,Other,an Executive Assistant 1,6 months,"On contrary, I would say disclose but know how to frame it and what you need. E.g I would mention I'm welcoming following up as this helps me remember about tasks or ask for written requests if someone calls me with elaborate ask.
From physical support, I asked for noise-cancelling headphones and we have quiet working zones (more separated desks, enclosed area, no calls) at each floor so there is less distractions. From things that would be helpful, captions in zoom calls and also voiceover in mandatory trainings that require a lot of reading.
From another angle, my opinion is that your immediate team can support you better if they know the diagnosis.",1,2024-09-17 22:10:24,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/i-always-hear-that-its-good-to-disclose-your-adhd-so-you-can-get-accomodations-but-i-dont-know-what-kind-of-accomodations,1,423,332

ADHD,Other,a Medical Sales Executive 1,5 months,"Hi there, I’m sorry you’re dealing with all of this. To calm myself, I try box breathing. Take as deep a breath as possible and hold, then inhale more and hold for less than a second and exhale with your lips pursed, as if exhaling through a straw. Repeat this 3 times and you’ll instantly feel more calm and relaxed.

How organized and clean is your life? I mean what does your work space, and home look like? Do you need to clean, organize and declutter? Doing this can help.

Journaling is a powerful tool. Set a timer for 10-15min and write everything that comes to mind without stopping to correct spelling or grammar. Do this 2-3 times a week or as needed. You can read back through what you’ve written and see if your tone or mood has changed.

Building off the writing, create a list of daily tasks and prioritize them. Don’t go nuts, try and stick with 3-5 tasks per day with some being a nice to have.","2

As a kid I was horrible. This got a bit better in my 20’s/30’s when I had a very rigid and busy schedule from 7 am to 11pm. but after I started running businesses I sleep when I can.

I can’t pull all nighters anymore but I have many nights of 2-3 hours sleep when I’m hyperfocused on a project or on a deadline. I can usually make up for it with taking time off after completing deliverables.

It’s not good for health, especially if you don’t make up sleep soon after.",,2024-09-18 12:17:22,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/do-you-have-a-solid-sleep-schedule-the-sheer-thrill-of-pulling-an-all-nighter-and-somehow-producing-a-brilliant-report-is,1,433,24

ADHD,Author,Authora Senior Manager,2 months,"I’ve tried both. Neither worked for me. Qelbree made me so tired and didn’t work. Vyvanse made me sleepy also, and though I was kind of focused, it was a dazed out focus. I was on Vyvanse first, then Qelbree was added.

Personally, I have had the best results with Focalin and Adderall. When I was on Focalin I took an XR (8hr release) in the morning, and a quick release (4hr) in the afternoon :) and then Adderall, I used to do the same thing, an XR in the morning and quick release in the afternoon. The XR just didn’t work for me like Focalin did. The second half of the XR wore off quickly. Right now, I’m on Adderall quick release 3x per day.

I also struggle to fall asleep (not quite insomnia) but my dr prescribed me hydroxyzine to shut my brain off at night. It’s been a game changer. It’s often prescribed as a PRN anxiety med, to calm an intense anxiety attack. It basically has the same effects as Benadryl, just without the allergy med part. I’ve found it to be non-addictive for me.

I know you didn’t ask for all of this but I’m wishing it gives you hope that there’s many more options and maybe some inspo for ideas to bring up to your doctor!!! <3",,2024-09-18 12:19:12,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/qelbree-does-anyone-have-any-success-stories-i-only-see-stories-of-terrible-side-effects-online-i-find-it-hard-to-believe,1,437,58

ADHD,Other,a Sales Advisor 1,a year,"ADHD and PR make a lovely couple in my experience. The hyper focus allows me to dig deep into industry trends for a wide range of clients. I get a leg up on monitoring issues for a given sector and effectively optimizing messaging—which is great for prospecting impact within their respective audiences (AI is a brilliant tool to help with this). From there I develop a portfolio by sector for those audiences to have on hand. It’s also been my super power when networking at conferences. I go down so many random rabbit holes when I’m researching which helps break the ice and find common ground with basically anyone. I call it “the power of knowing a little bit about a lot of stuff” lol. More recently I’ve found my adhd to be an amazing asset for adapting to change in any capacity. It seems like it’s way easier for me to adapt quickly to changing circumstances, specifically with regard to crisis and corporate reputation where situations can evolve rapidly.

ADHD,Other,an Associate Attorney 1,6 months,"Same thing happens to me even with medication. I was lucky to bill 5 hours when I was at (mostly) full concentration. My hours were terrible last year at my new firm as a result (I also am going through a divorce so there is/was a lot of personal stuff that also made it hard to concentrate on top of normal ADHD stuff). In addition to no raise (not even COL), they more or less told me that they were going to reduce my salary proportionally if my hours didn’t improve ASAP. Since then I don’t feel bad for billing even if I’m getting distracted and it’s taking longer than anticipated. I feel like it probably evens out a bit when I get hyper focused and am able to bang things out quickly. The partner can cut my time or give a discount if he thinks it’s too long, but he has not said anything other than keep getting those hours up so idk. But I’m also pretty open about my ADHD with him because it has helped us figure out the best strategies to work together and stay atop of our caseload. Regular checkins with him help keep me accountable and more on top of things rather than just feeling overwhelmed and paralyzed by doing certain things.

Also if it makes you feel any better, one associate at my old firm would bill like every time he randomly thought about a case and I his hours were really high as a result. With ADHD, I’m constantly thinking about what I need to be doing on cases, but don’t bill for most of that unless I’m actually sitting down to work on something so taking a little longer on things while distracted I think also evens that out.",4,2024-09-18 13:28:25,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/i-get-sidetracked-while-working-and-cut-my-hours-out-of-guilt-its-killing-me-how-tf-do-you-bill-8-hrs-a-day-with-adhd-serious,1,474,90

With regard to Cybersecurity, I feel like it’s very competitive and saturated with applicants. Case in point, I see many jobs on LinkedIn that have thousands of applicants for one job. I understand there is a percentage that are just views but still there are a lot of applicants.

I often get high numbers of applicants for roles I post, but I find a lot of them aren’t aligned to the qualifications I need.

It’s not bad to take a shot even if you aren’t quite there, but you can’t be all that surprised then if you don’t hear back on those roles.","1

80-90% of the words that come out of people’s mouths in client meetings longer than 15 minutes are irrelevant. It took me decades to fully embrace that fact.

Trick is to identify the important 10 - 20% while remaining engaged - or at least appearing engaged. If you can do that, you’re doing good.

Most of my client meetings now I either opt out of and let other people deal, or I keep them to 15 minutes or quick calls or text/audio message exchanges. Async comms is more efficient for most.

The only exception is if you’re leading a meeting like an investor preso/demo or hosting a workshop.

ADHD,Other,Authora National Recruitment Manager,2 months,"You just got to trust yourself. Often with ADHD, we are taught to question ourselves and constantly criticized for not fitting the mold society wants us to fit.

We got to realize it's not meant for us to fit. After all the mold is just to be a cog in the system for the 1%, nothing else.

See we, ND people are highly intelligent, highly creative, innovative thinkers. We aren't the fold, we are above it. We think outside of the box, innovate and creative. Our minds are built different. We are highly talented, just not great at being robots.

Given the power of the ADHD mind, it's obvious society is built to disconnect ND people from themselves and their own power. Hence we all overthink, question ourselves, spend excess energy in matters that truly don't matter. It's all designed that way.

Learn to let go, learn to trust yourself and your powers.

No the meds won't help you, they will help the corporations and 1% though.

What will help: Look yourself in the mirror every day, especially first thing in the morning and right before you go to sleep and say: ""I trust myself. I am powerful."" You can even add other phrases as you go: ""I am a leader. I am healthy. I am wealthy, etc""

This may sound silly and so simple. But it's truly the key. Your mind is on a program that is harming you and taking away from you. You need to reset and replace that program with the mindset I have shared.

If you can listen to this pattern of words while you are sleeping every night: EXTREMELY POWERFUL

ADHD,Other,a Customer Service Representative 1,2 months,"Dang, this is such a wonderful and uplifting post and I was about it pin it because I agreed with all of it... Until I saw the part about meds.

I used to think this way about meds, too. I refused to even consider them for a large portion of my 20s, and unfortunately, I believe that set me back at least a decade. I spent years trying to boost myself up, rode by bike everywhere, ate healthy, explored supplements, etc.

I still spent years in vicious cycles that I simply could not break myself out of. It was so incredibly frustrating at the time and I sincerely wish that I could go back and encourage past me to seek proper ADHD treatment and start the search again for meds that work for me.

The worst part was those years that I was spinning around, struggling, were some of the last years that I could have spent with my mother who died of brain cancer when I was 27. Yet I was stuck in these dysfunctional patterns that prevented me from spending quality time with my family and developing healthy relationships with friends.

Every day I would wake up with the intention of getting the things done that were holding me back. And every day I would do everything but those things, and by the end of the day I would feel so frustrated and pent up that I would go out dancing to let out some of that pent up frustration and get outside (these dysfunctional cycles kept me inside all day, as well, even in the Spring & Summer, because I kept on trying to *will* myself to do the things). Then I would stay up late, and be exhausted the following day and start over again.

This continued for years.

It wasn't until my early 30s that I started to consider meds again (I was diagnosed at 7yo and took meds until my late teens). I'm 40 now and it's only been in the last couple years that I've been able to dial my meds in. I'm planning on going back to school in the Fall because I just haven't been able to get my life together. I've been living in poverty and survival mode for so long. I'm so exhausted and think I have developed PTSD from my struggles. I'm trying my best, have been working with professionals regularly (luckily being poor qualifies me for state health care that covers everything). Yet I'm still trying to catch up on those things that I tried to *will* myself to do perpetually in my 20s.

Like you said, this society is not build for folks like us. To me, meds are just a tool to adapt to this non-ND-friendly society that we live in. I have every intention of utilizing them to catch me up to my life to make it more worth living. Luckily I haven't given up trying to live my life yet, because I attempted twice before I was 20, and have been so tempted a few times since.

My primary goal is to set my life and career up in such a way where I eventually won't need meds. I know this is possible and very much what I want to do, I'm just not there yet.

The main reason why I avoided meds for so long was because I was hanging out with ""open-minded"" people who shamed any use of them. I didn't want to be a pawn for big pharma, and I wanted to believe that I could genuinely do it myself. If we were living in a different society where my/our traits were more of an asset, I believe I could thrive without meds. But unfortunately, from my experience at least, it was an uphill battle for me without them. If I could go back in time and change things, this would honestly be one of my main priorities.

So, although I'm sure you mean well, trying to talk people out of using meds could potentially cause people to not get the leg up and support that they so desperately need.

Thank you for listening to my TED Talk. 😹

No intention of disclosing at work for me.

I know others do, but I don’t see what the benefit would be for me, personally. Although I do think many of my colleagues would think: “ah, so that’s what it is!”

Part two of your question is if it’s worth getting diagnosed as an adult. I think there’s something to say for having an answer, but if you’re reasonably confident enough and the alternative is to spend thousands of dollars (assuming US) to get a sheet of paper that says it then it’s your call.

There are some online fora where you can find this question explored - no real consensus but frankly that community is what gives me what I need so I don’t feel so alone.",2,2024-09-18 18:16:29,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/question-for-anyone-with-autism-spectrum-disorder-asd-how-has-a-diagnosis-helped-you-especially-at-work-i-suspect-i-have,1,514,57

ADHD,Other,Forecom (unverified) 1,6 months,"Look into Dr. Daniel Amen, he is a psychiatrist giving advice on how many of these mental health issues come from poor diet, gut health, TBI, and more. There are specific diets and supps you can use as an intervention and see if they help. Another great source is Christopher Palmer, a Harvard Psychiatrist. They have written books and are active on ig.

In short, get your diet in check (eat clean, whole foods, fermented food like sauerkraut, kefir or kimchi, a lot of protein, fish, eggs, red meat, fruits and veggies), do weight training at least 3 times a week, meditate, explore breathwork (works magic if you’re consitent - look into wim hof breathing or psychological sight), expose your eyes to the sun especially in the morning…

Otherwise, definitely see a psychologist/psychiatrist. Just think twice before going on benzos or similar drugs, they are oftentimes just a band aid solution.

ADHD,Author,a Project Leader 1,a year,"While you might have undiagnosed ADHD.

I’m curious about a few things. What part of the question do you not understand from your colleagues? Why do you zone out?

Are you working really hard to pay attention and then you have to take a mental break, aka zone out?

Do you have to have captions on to watch tv, be on phone calls? Do you “read” people’s lips to keep up with the conversation? Zone out when you can’t keep up?

Do you heard the sounds of the words but there isn’t any comprehension of the words being said? Like listening to the teacher on the Peanuts (Charlie brown) tv show?

Is it better when they type a question to you vs a phone call or face to face?

In addition to possibly seeing someone to confirm an adhd diagnosis,

if any of these questions are true for you, I would schedule an appointment with an ENT - ear nose throat specialist. You might have a form of hearing loss or something where your brain hears things but doesn’t translate it correctly. The ENT can look your ears, nerves, and a hearing test to see if this is the case.",3,2024-09-18 18:17:44,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/hi-im-pretty-sure-i-have-undiagnosed-adhd-i-have-a-lot-of-trouble-paying-attention-to-meetings-and-even-conversations-i,1,517,77

Plus, assuming you want prescriptions, the usual treatments are controlled substances, and prescribing those without a legit medical evaluation is a good way to lose a license or wind up in jail.

ADHD,Other,an Associate 1,a year,"Seconding SSE1, it’s hard enough to find an “affordable” place to get a diagnosed let alone free.

Also found that most adult adhd specialists that diagnose do not take insurance. Sorry it’s not a good answer, but there is definitely a huge cost barrier to getting help.

You do need to go to your primary care doctor let him ask some simple questions to see if you do have adult ADHD. For some reason medical insurance think you go to your primary doctor so often you are like best buddies with him/ her I think doctor mike said that. Because some therapists don't do the medication side of things and that what insurance companies are afraid of. It might be redundant to have to go 3 doctors to get a referral for ADHD but again it's for your safety and so you don't end up suing one the doctors if they misdiagnosed you.,1,2024-09-18 18:28:32,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/i-am-needing-to-get-adhd-or-autism-testing-i-already-see-a-therapist-shouldnt-they-be-able-to-do-the-testing-mine-said-i-needed-to,1,543,67
ADHD,Other,a Staff Software Engineer 1,6 months,"Therapists are usually professional psychologists. Psychologists are not licensed physicians - which means they can't prescribe medications, and are limited in what diagnoses they can make (and their diagnoses won't always be accepted by physicians, especially when it comes to prescribing medications).

To get a diagnosis that will be broadly accepted, you will need to get the testing done by a psychiatrist, which is a physician with specialized training in psychiatric conditions (including ADHD and autism).

A lot of health insurance plans require you to see your primary care doctor for a referral before seeing a specialist of any sort. It's a cost saving measure for them, if your primary care doctor doesn't think it's necessary they're supposed to say no (plus it adds a step and so some people just won't bother).

ADHD,Other,a Chief Executive Officer 1,5 months,"Put all tasks and interim task goals on your calendar. Sometimes deadlines are missed because of procrastination and perfectionism. It can also be easy to start a project then get bored and wait till the last moments to finish it

Find someone else to keep you accountable. For example, if you have a project due in two weeks, set a soft deadline to your client that you’ll deliver a first draft in a week, and the final for review before it’s due. This way you have multiple smaller projects instead of one big project.

Also give yourself plenty of time each morning to review your priorities/calendar and plan your day. At least 30 minutes of review and planning before you do any work can help so you don’t dive into a lower priority project and lose time.

I also don’t like the term “deadline”. It’s a small thing, but adds stress unnecessarily as it feels like whatever is delivered has to be perfect at that time and seems to encourage all nighters. Instead make small progress each day towards the goal. You might find you’ll get things done earlier than expected if you don’t have a scary big red X on some future date.",3,2024-09-18 18:30:04,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/my-time-management-is-a-disaster-no-matter-how-hard-i-try-missed-deadlines-galore-even-basic-tasks-get-forgotten-are-there-any,1,547,82

I have done all these things independently for extended periods and have not had positive results but together, I have had results.

Unfortunately for me the ""come to Jesus"" moment only occured over the last two years where I've realised that I've been impacted by ADHD for my whole career to date. It explains why I work well in the BPM space where I bring structure to chaos using industry frameworks, visual means, mentoring and training others. Sadly, when you are around others who dont have that depth of understanding in your space and things are made up as they go along it (why I don't agree that agile applies to every initiative) creates enormous anxiety and frustration as you're prevented from following tried, true and tested methodologies that do yield rapid results.

ADHD,Other,Authoran Attorney,2 months,"…to partner at either a midsize or large firm. I feel like a fraud and that I haven’t earned it. Due to jumping around and mixing two related practice areas, I haven’t been trained up well. Also, this is like a second career for me and while my first was a role doing quasi-legal work in the same niche, I’ve been practicing fewer years than I should to become partner (4-6).

Can anyone relate and have any advice? This doesn’t feel like it’s just imposter syndrome, it’s actually being an imposter. I feel like I will go to next place and be found out and have to move again or clients will stop coming to me (unless I can somehow find great associates to do the work and I just manage from above which would be ideal since I’m terrible at the actual work).",2,2024-09-18 18:45:05,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/ive-somehow-lasted-in-the-legal-industry-despite-my-adhd-which-was-diagnosed-late-this-isnt-second-career-for-me-and-i-cant,1,578,40
ADHD,Other,an Attorney 1,2 months,"Well, how have you gotten so far and built a book if you’re terrible at the work? Do more of what you’re good at. Find those associates to do the work. Try to hang on for longer than a year in your next place because eventually the record of moving every year will catch up to you. It sounds like you know all this, though.

Other ideas — try going in house to a role where you are mainly deciding on the issues but managing outside counsel which is doing the actual work? I’m in house and this is not my reality, but I have peers at other companies whose role is like this. I don’t know how to find this type of role, though.

Also, make sure you’re saving your money for a day when you might not be able to land another job, or have an extended search, or where your next role pays substantially less.
