Bipolar,Other,a Consultant 2,8 months,"Bipolar disorder is highly treatable if the person actually takes care of themselves. Does she? I would not run but would ask her to really help you understand how bad can/ does it get? What does it look like for her when things are bad? What can u do to support her during those times? What are the things she's learned help her stay stable?

If she told you, that's a good sign. Find out if she's in therapy, etc. absolutely can't go untreated.",31,9/20/24 11:34,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/new-almost-gf-told-me-shes-diagnosed-with-bipolar-type-2-should-i-be-understanding-and-be-okay-with-that-or-should-i-run-dont-wanna,1,1,1

Bipolar,Other,an Assistant Director - Delivery Manager 1,8 months,"Wow, I'm amazed at the number of people saying run. Especially since it's 2024, and people are finally more open about their mental health. It must have taken so much courage for her to share her diagnosis with you.

I personally have it and have been medicated since diagnosis in 2018. It takes some trial and error to find the right medications, but once you are all good, you are set to succeed in life.

We are capable of love and just have slightly stronger emotions than the average person. I have been with my husband since 2015, and he has helped me through this diagnosis and overcome obstacles. If you are ready to dedicate yourself 100% to her and be there for her through her ups and downs, you will have a huge sense of fulfillment.

Most people with BP2 sit mostly in depressive phases as opposed to hypomania, but it depends on the person.

Bipolar,Other,an Associate Creative Director 1,8 months,"PWC - I understand if it‚Äôs untreated, it can be difficult, but many mental illnesses are very treatable. There are a range of symptom severity and complex manifestations. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to write everyone with a mental illness off as basically undateable/unlovable just because of how someone else behaved. People without mental illnesses can be abusive and cause chronic stress. People with mental illnesses can be some of the loveliest people. There is no clinical association between mental illness and rates of abusive behavior. People with mental illness are far more likely to harm themselves than to harm others.","8

Bipolar,Other,a Director 2,8 months,"Thank you for sharing your story! The stigma is really crazy as are the comments on this thread. I‚Äôve been with my husband since 2009, he got diagnosed after 13 years together, it was my pregnancy along with physical health issues that triggered his first and only manic episode and it was so rough. We‚Äôre only just now starting to get to stability 15 months after his diagnosis. He‚Äôs been committed to his meds since diagnosis but I found the meds were only half the battle. He was also self medicating so he‚Äôs had a couple of rehab stays and so much therapy to get him to a stable place. What work did you and your husband do to heal and repair after your diagnosis? We‚Äôve been doing couples therapy since before his diagnosis, just curious what has worked for you ‚ò∫Ô∏è","4

Bipolar,Other,PwC 2,8 months,"Ad1, i agree that people supposedly with no issues could be abusive and manipulative on purpose, while someone with mental illness is more of a victim of their situation and not causing stress to their partner voluntarily. I am saying not all of us have that kind of fortitude. Just look at number of parents abusing their own kids just because they can. Humans are not as resilient to deal with another's issues, most of us are barely keeping it together with our own issues.","3

Bipolar,Other,an Assistant Director - Delivery Manager 1,8 months,"@D2, my depression started due to a traumatic experience when I was 12 years old. Since then, I have had wicked anxiety and on and off depressive spells, which is a big sign of BP2. I didn't start antidepressants until I was in university. That's when the hypomanic episodes started. They were all antidepressant induced. I had an out of body experience on one of the medications, and so the GP doctor took me off of it instead of getting me a psych consult. That would have been 2015-2018, when I was jumping back and forth between untreated depressive episodes and the minor hypomanic episode. Most of the hypomanic episodes were barely noticeable. I wouldn't be able to sleep. I would have no appetite. And I would be in a generally good mood, with the occasional quick anger reaction. It was never anything serious, though, where I had to go to the hospital and stay overnight. My husband and I have lived together since mid-2017, and I got diagnosed mid-2018, so he really only had to put up with it for about a year. I never took anything out on him. My anger was normally directed towards my parents, as we were living at home with my parents, and I was working 4 jobs to pay back my university debt. We chalked it up to being stress induced for a while, as I was working 15+ hours a day and only took 1 day off every other week. We never did couples therapy, but when I finally got the right medications, my mood started to level out, and I was able to be more involved in my relationship instead of crippling anxiety and depression. I never got to the point where I had thoughts of hurting myself or anything. It was always just mild depression, where I didn't want to get out of bed and was eating more food than normal. Overall, we didn't do anything special to fix our relationship, as nothing was broken from the get-go. We just continued to be open and honest with each other and to trust each other through the process. Over the years, I have switched medications a few times due to severe side effects, which occasionally lead to a break through depressive episode. When I am depressed, my husband will take care of me and help out around the house more because he understands that it's not my fault and that it's just part of my life. They tend to only last up to a week or two now if anything happens (a family member passes away, or something else bad triggers them), whereas before, I could be depressed for months on end.

Wishing your husband good health and for you two to have a happy life together. üíñ You just need to be his rock when he is having a rough go. Try not to take anything personally, either. I'm sure he means no ill will when he is having an episode.","6

Bipolar,Other,an Attorney 1,8 months,"Do you all pushing against others saying no think that shaming others is conducive to a healthy relationship? Why would you want to be in a relationship with someone who is only there out of societal obligation? Everyone has their own capabilities and circumstances. I have a lot of alcoholics in my family and bluntly, wouldn't date an alcoholic, even a totally sober one. Been there, seen that.

Bipolar,Other,an Associate Creative Director 1,8 months,"No one is shaming people for not dating mentally ill people. We are pushing back on the shame they are spreading toward mentally ill people by saying ‚Äúrun‚Äù without context on the individual and all the other dumb stuff in this thread. It‚Äôs one thing to hold a personal prejudice against dating mentally ill people; it‚Äôs another to use your opinion to paint all mentally ill people as undateable based on anecdotal experience and push that view on others. There is a huge spectrum of mental illness and usually you only hear the extreme stories, so it is stigmatizing for people to use those extreme stories against everyone who could be suffering but not creating problems for others. Having a personal dating preference doesn‚Äôt give people the right to spread misinformation and stigmatize others.

It‚Äôs worth calling out people who stigmatize mental illness because the stigma is a huge reason for why su*cidal people feel alone, rejected, burdensome, unlovable, and irredeemable. The way we speak about people who are struggling matters. The same way it‚Äôs generally unacceptable to be bashing someone with cancer for being disabled and needing care.","3

Being cheated on or heartbroken is hard enough for a neurotypical person to deal with. Having BP2 will make it even harder if they decide to mess around with other people. It doesn't mean they have to commit to life with them, only them, get married to them, and the works. Its just that they need to be ready to commit to a life that may have more challenges than the average person. They need to commit to making her health a priority in their relationship. If they aren't mature enough to be that support system/person for this girl, OP needs to move on and let her find someone who will be there for her. That's what I meant by 100% dedication.","1

Bipolar,Author,a Manager 1,a year,"I have severe anxiety that leads to depression. Not BPD but I have spent time in an in patient facility before when it‚Äôs gotten bad. Is he on any medication? They aren‚Äôt for everyone, but they totally transformed my life. If you‚Äôre able to visit him at the inpatient facility, do. Make that time. It feels amazing to have visitors while you‚Äôre there. Remind him to take part in all the activities they offer even if he thinks they‚Äôre silly. I felt like a child during most of them but somehow I think they did help me. His degree can wait. He can finish when he‚Äôs ready. I should‚Äôve taken a pause during college but didn‚Äôt and I barely graduated because my grades suffered and that made getting my first job I consulting really difficult. Better to pause and even finish when up to it. I encourage journaling and physical activity (although they make that hard at in patient facilities since you usually can‚Äôt go outside). If they allow normal clothing at his facility, that can make a vast improvement. It‚Äôs no fun being in there, but it does help. It‚Äôll be rough on you and your partner to see him in there but trust me, it helps. I know it took a toll on my husband while I was there for almost a week, but having him visit meant the world and having him as a support system helped me through.",10,9/20/24 10:34,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/step-son-recently-diagnosed-bipolar-senior-year-at-usc-had-to-pull-out-of-school-fly-back-home-and-entered-in-patient-facility-by,1,2,105

Barely graduated because of depression, first job was rough, in patient several times, many leaves from work. I recommend same as M1 plus - out patient after in patient is helpful. Find a psychiatrist and therapist. It will take time to find one that is a good fit; same with medication. I can attest, from a VERY bad place to where I am now, having those things makes a world of difference. Everything else can wait, mental health can not, and healthy coping skills/habits will become important.","2

Bipolar,Author,Author works at Accenture,a year,"Thank you so much. We are not able to visit and no cell phones are permitted either. He was taking meds for anxiety and depression. I think those were stopped when he arrived back home last week. His doctors out in LA were not as helpful as the ones he used to see in our hometown.

We'll do everything we can for him, obviously. He's also transgender so on top of the mental health things being accepted is another challenge he's faced. Testosterone treatments have helped with appearing male as well as top surgery before he went into college.

His whole life had revolved around success. Maintained a 4.3 GPA In high school in the Cambridge program. 4.1 at USC. Slippage started when he got back from summer break and it was devastating. He attends school of cinematic arts and was fired from a set...unable to concentrate even on simplest of things. Suicidal thoughts constantly now.

We remain hopeful that treatment, proper medication and counseling will help get him back on track.","4

Bipolar,Other,a Manager 1,a year,"Agree with M2 about out patient support. Sadly it‚Äôs hard to get into outpatient programs, but it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to start looking for a PHP or IOP program now. It took 3 months for me to hear back from an IOP with an opening and by then I was back at work. Definitely having a therapist and psychiatrist lined up will help. I was seeing my therapist 3 times a week when I first got home. Also potentially changing meds may help. I had been on one for years no problem but it no longer worked. Changing made a huge difference. I also went from 4.0+ to barely passing and that is super painful for someone who has always achieved highly. I feel that pain. Is it possible for him to continue seeing his hometown therapists? Telehealth? Mine was able to do that thankfully since I was striking out with other therapists. Just know your alls support is huge. It‚Äôs a super scary time for him and for you guys and a strong support system is the foundation for pulling through the dark times.","3

Hard to lose him to this, but you will have flashes of him through the year and if he can stay med compliant in stretches he should be ok. Get a family therapist for you and your wife as this will try your relationship with each other and with him. Lots of people go through it, those with a strong network of support and family therapy make it to the other side in good shape.

Bipolar,Author,Authoran Associate,a year,"A1 everyone‚Äôs different and I‚Äôd be cautious of making commentary like that about bipolar people as someone who doesn‚Äôt have the disease, even if your dad did. My first and every other episode I was very cognizant of it from the start and sought out help. I wasn‚Äôt cognizant of how bad i looked or the extent of it, but I certainly have the insight to know ‚Äúshit, I‚Äôm in an episode right now.‚Äù For instance, my first episode, I had never heard of bipolar before in my life and thought it just meant ‚Äúcraz.‚Äù First week of no sleep I took a few online tests and self diagnosed without having any prior knowledge. I obviously had a doctor confirm my diagnosis but I was 100% right.

Did I act like a fool while thinking I was like on a higher plane of existence then everyone else? Sure. But I had clear consciousness of the fact that it wasn‚Äôt normal and I need meds.

On top of that, any severe episode I‚Äôve had has been managed by upping my regulars and getting daily klonopin. All I have to do is email one line to my doctor and walk down the street to grab it. I can do that even if I‚Äôm tripping lol.

And luckily, my family and friends and therapist are very conscious of when I become hyper verbal and supplement my awareness.

I think family members of bipolar who are non-bipolar have a justified but skewed understanding of the disease because of the trauma they experience living alongside it. I‚Äôm not in denial, your father might have been, but I‚Äôve never had an episode without knowing it.

It‚Äôs also pretty obvious when you start hallucinating. If I‚Äôm seeing things or think dead people are talking to me, I don‚Äôt have to question I‚Äôm manic and need more meds.

Im not messing around with anything‚Ä¶I take it very seriously and as a minority women who has experienced severe employment discrimination in my life having a prestigious job like this is necessary to jumpstart a career that was going nowhere.",,9/20/24 10:35,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/any-bipolar-associates-find-pulling-these-hours-just-like-significantly-harder-than-others-people-talk-about-working,8,3,145

Bipolar,Other,a Deputy General Counsel 1,a year,"Bipolar and BigLaw is such a difficult combination. I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre dealing with this. I made it work for nearly a decade but it was so hard and I had so many really rough periods. The stress and lack of sleep caused a lot of mood issues and made finding the right medication balance really hard because no medication can undo prolonged sleep deprivation, and as you know, changing medications means lots of side effects to deal with (yay lithium tremors!). The worst times were when work stress would overlap with personal stress.

I ultimately decided to go in-house as a senior associate. There were lots of other reasons I made that choice, but this is the one that should have been the deciding factor. I am SO much more stable these days. I‚Äôve reduced or stopped multiple medications and my moods are still very manageable. I no longer feel like a zombie! I tell people this all the time, but I truly didn‚Äôt know how bad BigLaw was for me until I left. I was hanging on by a thread for years and just wasn‚Äôt thinking clearly enough or didn‚Äôt have enough perspective to really understand why until I left. Not only do I get enough sleep now, but I also have time to consistently do the things that help me stay stable like exercise and eat regular balanced meals.

I love my job now, but I‚Äôll admit that it‚Äôs hard to feel held back by your mental health. It feels incredibly unfair, and it‚Äôs even harder when you can‚Äôt really talk about it and even if you did, people wouldn‚Äôt understand.

Bipolar,Other,an Associate 1,8 months,"My husband does similar things and I feel like people saying, ""just set boundaries"" really don't know what it's like, so, a more practical piece of advice: put her notifications on mute or just plain block her during the work day. Then, at the end of the day (or whenever you feel up to it), you can unmute/unblock and respond. This is a friend, not your immediate family, so you are not responsible for fixing her emergencies. I haven't tried with my Android, but iPhones have that ""I can't text because I'm driving"" Do Not Disturb option that you can toggle on to send automatic replies. You can set the automatic message to whatever you want. I suspect that a large part of her behavior towards you is motivated by anxiety that's too big for her to manage. So she ends up pushing that anxiety on to you, and if she's being ignored, it ratchets up her anxiety and she starts escalating. An automatic response is a good way to shut down that process.
I can't always do that with my husband because we do still have life stuff to coordinate, but about 50% of the time, he's just calling/texting me in ""doomsday mode"" about problems that he can solve himself and which usually aren't that big of a deal, and my attempts to (metaphorically) talk him off the ledge are never successful and the whole exchange just gives ME a lot of unnecessary anxiety, causes more conflict in our relationship, and distracts me from work. If I don't engage, I skip out on most of that and 9 times out of 10, he's already solved whatever it is by the time I'm able to get back to him.",1,9/20/24 10:35,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/so-i-have-a-longtime-friend-that-keeps-coming-to-me-for-hr-advice-and-she-wants-me-to-give-her-permission-to-use-her-ada-accommodations-we,1,4,202

Bipolar,Author,Authora HR and Payroll Manager,8 months,"OP look up Vicarious trauma or secondary trauma to help explain to your friend how constant exposure to her trauma and your husband‚Äôs trauma will lead you to suffer too. That means, you will not be able to be there for your friend because you will have your own trauma to deal with as a result of the constant exposure to her trauma.

Look up the holistic psychologist, she has empathetic guidance on how to phrase and state boundaries. You need to keep up the boundaries you set, and you need to understand that it is not your job to save your husband or your friend.

Bipolar,Other,,8 months,"I am not suggesting that end the friendship out. I am suggesting that you become less available and less responsive so that both of you can learn to respect the boundaries you set.

I used to be you: empathetic , people pleaser, people fixer. Then one day I cut off everyone because I had been suffering from vicarious trauma from my personal and professional life (yes those of us in the service oriented work suffer it from being exposed to our clients‚Äô trauma).

If boundaries are not set and respected, your secondary trauma will put you in flight mode and force you to end the friendship.

Taking a break and giving yourself space is important. That will naturally teach her to get used to not bombard you 24/7 with messages and calls, and will teach her to not expect an immediate response from you. Giving yourself space and time to respond to her will also teach her to work on herself and with professional resources instead of coming to you for everything.

It will also train your brain to not be reactive or feel the urge to go help her whenever she texts or call.

You are a good friend, and I hope she will be a good friend to you too by understanding your risk of vicarious trauma.","1

The result in her final diagnosis was that she actually had a manic episode and hallucinated her dead parents. She was in the psych ward of a hospital for a little bit to get her aligned. Being medicated has done her wonders by just leveling herself out.

Bipolar,Other,a Data Entry Operator 1,a year,"The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in the workplace and requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified employees with disabilities. The ADA applies to all disabilities and does not allow employers to treat one disability differently than another when it comes to providing accommodations.

Employers must engage in an interactive process with employees who request accommodations to determine the most appropriate and reasonable accommodations based on the individual's specific needs and the nature of their disability. The goal is to ensure that employees with disabilities have equal opportunities to perform their jobs effectively.

In your friend's case, her employer should not treat her differently or subject her to more frequent job performance evaluations solely because she has requested ADA accommodations for her bipolar disorder. It's essential for your friend to communicate with her employer about her specific accommodation needs and work together to find reasonable solutions that allow her to perform her job effectively.

If your friend feels that her employer is not following ADA guidelines or is discriminating against her because of her disability, she may want to consider seeking guidance from an attorney who specializes in disability discrimination cases or contacting her local Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) office to discuss her concerns and explore potential remedies.

It's important for employers to understand their obligations under the ADA and to provide accommodations in a fair and consistent manner, regardless of the specific disability involved. Discrimination based on disability is illegal under the ADA, and employees have rights and protections to ensure they are treated fairly and equitably in the workplace.",,9/20/24 10:37,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/so-i-have-a-friend-yes-a-friend-and-not-me-working-for-a-large-corporation-and-shes-having-trouble-filing-her-ada-accommodations-for-her,1,8,282

I suppose any advice I have depends on where you are in the process. When I was still getting my meds dialed in I basically just had to say F*** it, we‚Äôll see what happens.

Keep at it. I don‚Äôt think you can trust yourself to know where you‚Äôre at. So build support. I‚Äôve always done weekly therapy. Again, risk averse, so I like supervision. Anytime I feel the slightest outside myself I ask my wife what she thinks.

Bipolar,Other,"an Infrastructure, Modern Workplace Engineer 1",a year,"My HONEST opinion? üëÄ Many mental illnesses are a physical manifestation of some kind of spiritual affliction that frankly you will need deliverance from. As bible believing Christians, we should carry the understanding that no issue is too hard for God to resolve. Jesus gives us a blueprint that some things are a matter of deliverance and the spirit behind that thing need to be cast out. With some kinds of mental health issues, medication is only try to put a bandaid of a symptom as opposed to dealing with the thing causing it. You can take all the medication you want but the spirit behind the mental affliction is still there if you don‚Äôt get deliverance. At the same time, I understand that not every Christian carries a certain level of faith or this same level of knowledge and understanding. If the person is someone who they know they dont carry the faith they need in trusting God for deliverance then I completely understand if they take the medication. Faith is not something we can force as much as i wish it was! But the real truth in the situation is that God can heal and deliver us from every kind of mental affliction, it‚Äôs just a matter of having this revelation and access to someone who may be able to guide you in deliverance.

I‚Äôve had struggled with depression and other mental health issues myself. I never went to get medication. The day the Lord taught me that it was a spirit behind the issue that needed to be CAST OUT was the same day the Lord delivered me and Ive never had any of those issues since!

Bipolar,Other,EY 1,a year,"I‚Äôve been a Management Consultant for almost 2 decades. Recently my spouse and I have committed to start a practice to help Child & Adolescents. She‚Äôs double-board certified in Adult And CAP.

I‚Äôve worked with her in this space for a long time. I‚Äôve seen first hand when a patient comes in professing to be possessed by or engaging with demons AND patients who are experiencing depression, bipolar and other conditions which require meds. Sometimes patients exhibit issues that require deliverance AND can benefit from the help that meds provide.

The issue is that some church leaders over-emphasize deliverance, fasting and prayer instead of medication due to ignorance. Sometimes only one or the other is required to help the patient‚Ä¶ sometimes both. And this is part of a broader issue in SOME churches (especially in under-represented communities). Some local pastors are ill-equipped (personally or just plain lack the resources) to address all issues of their congregants (e.g. providing marital counseling and they have no counseling training, not addressing financial stewardship, etc.)

I view this as an opportunity to educate and advocate within our churches to help people understand that if you take an antibiotic or pain meds for a broken foot or high-blood pressure meds, it‚Äôs may not be any different.

Bottomline: Medicine can be used for these disorders, but unlike other fields of medicine, you need a provider who is equally comfortable with identifying and addressing the spiritual issues as well the medical.

Bipolar,Other,a Vice President 1,4 months,"Penalties for a psychologist making a diagnosis after only one hour without sufficient information can vary depending on the jurisdiction, the specific circumstances, and whether the behavior is reported and investigated. Potential penalties can include:

1. **Professional Sanctions**: The psychologist may face disciplinary action from their state licensing board, which could include suspension or revocation of their license, fines, mandatory supervision, or required additional training.

2. **Ethics Violations**: The APA can impose sanctions on its members for violating ethical guidelines, which could range from a reprimand to expulsion from the association.

3. **Legal Consequences**: If the premature diagnosis leads to harm, the psychologist could face civil lawsuits for malpractice. This could result in financial compensation to the patient and potentially damage the psychologist's professional reputation.

4. **Employment Consequences**: The psychologist's employer might take action, which could include termination of employment.

These actions are based on the ethical standards outlined in the APA's Ethics Code, particularly under sections concerning competence and the necessity of sufficient information before making professional judgments.

You are beyond delusional. You will find ZERO articles or professional links to support your claim. I've already linked to the relevant APA section.,,9/20/24 10:42,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/ive-worked-with-two-therapists-and-a-psychiatrist-the-therapists-i-worked-with-for-3-months-and-4-months-the-psych-i-saw-for,9,21,422
Bipolar,Other,a Vice President 1,4 months,"Diagnosing bipolar disorder involves a comprehensive assessment by a licensed mental health professional, often following specific guidelines and using established diagnostic tools. Here are the steps typically involved:

1. **Clinical Interview**: The clinician conducts a thorough interview to gather information about the patient's history, symptoms, and overall functioning. This includes exploring mood changes, energy levels, behavior, sleep patterns, and any psychotic symptoms.

2. **Medical History**: The clinician reviews the patient's medical history to rule out any physical conditions that could be causing the symptoms. This may include a physical examination and lab tests.

3. **Family History**: Since bipolar disorder can have a genetic component, understanding the family history of mental health issues can be crucial.

4. **Standardized Diagnostic Tools**: The clinician may use standardized questionnaires and rating scales such as:
- **Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ)**: A screening tool that helps identify the presence of bipolar disorder symptoms.
- **Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)**: Measures the severity of manic episodes.
- **Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS)**: Assesses the severity of depressive symptoms.

5. **DSM-5 Criteria**: The diagnosis is confirmed using the criteria outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). For bipolar disorder, this includes:
- **Bipolar I Disorder**: Characterized by one or more manic episodes, possibly accompanied by major depressive episodes.
- **Bipolar II Disorder**: Characterized by one or more major depressive episodes and at least one hypomanic episode.
- **Cyclothymic Disorder**: Chronic fluctuating mood disturbance involving numerous periods of hypomanic symptoms and depressive symptoms that do not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode.

6. **Differential Diagnosis**: The clinician rules out other potential causes for the symptoms, such as other psychiatric disorders (e.g., major depressive disorder, schizophrenia), substance abuse, or medical conditions.

Bipolar,Other,Forecom (unverified) 1,6 months,"Look into Dr. Daniel Amen, he is a psychiatrist giving advice on how many of these mental health issues come from poor diet, gut health, TBI, and more. There are specific diets and supps you can use as an intervention and see if they help. Another great source is Christopher Palmer, a Harvard Psychiatrist. They have written books and are active on ig.

In short, get your diet in check (eat clean, whole foods, fermented food like sauerkraut, kefir or kimchi, a lot of protein, fish, eggs, red meat, fruits and veggies), do weight training at least 3 times a week, meditate, explore breathwork (works magic if you‚Äôre consitent - look into wim hof breathing or psychological sight), expose your eyes to the sun especially in the morning‚Ä¶

Otherwise, definitely see a psychologist/psychiatrist. Just think twice before going on benzos or similar drugs, they are oftentimes just a band aid solution.

Psychiatric disorders are ""real medical disorders"" and they have outwards signs if they didnt you wouldn't have lost all those jobs. The issue is when you went in for the disability exam with the psychiatrist you probably went in acting as normal as possible to show them just how normal you were and that you could ace all their tests. You should have went in after not taking your meds for a couple weeks and taken an SSRI like Prozac by itself for 2 weeks prior to the appointment.

Pills usually end up numbing the problem and our ADHD problems dont just go away, so the best strategy is to learn how to become stronger at handling those problems.
