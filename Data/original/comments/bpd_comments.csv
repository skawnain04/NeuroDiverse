BPD,Other,a Manager 1,6 months,"My mom had BPD. She got worse and worse. One day she flipped on my dad as they do with the black and white thinking and decided he was all evil. I don't think any enemy in the world could've done more damage to another human being than she did to him. He dropped dead at 60 from heart failure because of all the stress and fear destroying his heart from all the evil things she did. My siblings and I were collateral damage and terribly harmed by her evil actions too. But she didn't care who else got hurt so long as she could hurt our dad it became her singular goal and obsession.

She mellowed out a bit in her late 50s as is usually with borderlines, but by then my dad was dead and I and my siblings childhoods were destroyed and we were given lifelong deep psychological wounds and a ton of traumatic memories.

If you haven't bred with her yet RUUUUUUN! If you have already bred with her your life needs to be about protecting the innocent lives you created from that monster.",12,9/20/24 14:20,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/anyone-married-to-a-person-with-borderline-personality-disorder-bpd-its-been-8-years-and-im-tired-do-they-get-better,1,1,3
BPD,Other,a Manager 1,6 months,"Btw my father was the kindest, most gentle and generous man in the world. He did nothing to deserve that, but the borderlines aren't rational their mental illness one day tells them a person they formerly put on a pedastle is now evil and no amount of evidence to the contrary will ever persuade them of the truth. Though the truth was that he was an incredible person and she was desperately mental ill and needed to have her children taken away from her because she was so unstable they weren't safe. I lived in the worst state for falter's rights in the country but even that state eventually granted my father full custody, which is almost impossible to get in that state.","7

BPD,Other,a Senior Manager 2,6 months,"My husband had a very similar upbringing and his dad also finally got full custody of him/Sibling and only time with his mom was supervised visitation. My husband ultimately made the decision to no longer have contact with his biological mom after he turned 18. It's incredibly hard to hear the stories and what he experienced as a child and for him to reconcile what she did with knowing that somewhere in her heart she loved him has definitely been hard. At one point his mom tried to drive her car into the lake with him and his Sibling in the backseat but someone saw her do that and called the cops, so luckily they were OK.

BPD,Other,a Manager 1,6 months,"PwC1 What BCG1 said is accurate. The constant gaslighting is intense. I spent most of my childhood and young adulthood doubting my memories and sanity because she constantly tried to convince me I was crazy and that my memories were false and tried to implant fake memories. When I was in my early 20s I went on a mission to obtain all the court records, police reports, medical records, and interview all the adults from my childhood to verify that my memories were real and what happened was real.

Other examples she tried to kidnap my siblings and me once when my father was going to be out of town on a business trip, so I told my dad. As punishment she refused to acknowledge my existence (I was like 9 at the time) like wouldn't feed me or care for me and made all my siblings refuse to acknowledge my existence too and would have them all call me traitor as the only interaction they had with me. That lasted for a month then she acted like I was her favorite person in the world.

Borderlines need to have a scapegoat someone on the outs they can get everyone to abuse together, when Borderlines have multiple children the scapegoat can transition between 2 or more kids. My oldest sister was the golden child. My 2nd sister was usually the scapegoat. I was usually the Lost child. And my baby sibling was usually the clown. But us younger 3 all could sometimes be the Scapegoat our roles weren't as fixed as the oldest's.

It's like constant volatility in the relationship with a Borderline. When she would approach me I never knew if she was going to give me a hug, playfully tickle me while telling me jokes, or if she was going to knock me on the ground kick me when I was down and drag me to the basement by my hair to beat me more. She could even start by like tickling and joking with me but something in her diseased mind would get triggered and then she'd start beating me because in her mind I would become some terrible POS.

She could be the most alluring, fun, incredible, entertaining, charismatic woman in the world. Like a magical fairy. But then she'd flip because you became bad in her eyes and she could be the most cruel, violent, sadistic demon like she had waltzed directly out of h3ll. I almost think having a straight up malignant narcissist mother would've been easier as at least you always know what you're getting with that.","4

BPD,Other,a Management Consultant 2,6 months,"Omg M1 that‚Äôs the most accurate description ever. I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to put all this into words. Bravo

When my mum was out for some hobby, my sisters and my dad would take guesses in which mood she‚Äôd arrive home. Would we have an amazing night? Or would someone have to call the police again?
One day we were her angels, and in the next moment she‚Äôd treat us like we came from the pits of hell. As a child you don‚Äôt understand, because nothing rational could‚Äôve caused this kind of behaviour.

I‚Äôd advocate for BPD people to not be allowed to have children.","4

No matter how hard you try, or tiptoe on eggshells, or attempt to please them, there is no pleasing them or getting it right. So you have to fully accept that you are the problem, you are the faulty one, you are in error, and everything you do is incorrect and merits whatever punishment they dole out (anger, violence, silent treatment, threats of self-harm, attacks, etc.).

If you have children, they have to be raised to accept that they are always wrong and merit being punished. You all have to live with the constant fear of some other shoe being dropped, which you will of course be at fault for, and what happens next is your own fault for not correctly pre-guessing what you should have done.

BPD,Other,a Hostess 1,9 months,"I‚Äôm sure you love your partner and you want to make it work, but it doesn‚Äôt sound like they‚Äôre ready for a relationship.

As someone with BPD, I can say with certainty that it‚Äôs not on you, the partner, to ‚Äúhandle‚Äù the irrational behavior. Your partner should seek therapy and only be in relationships once they‚Äôve learned how to cope with and regulate their symptoms. My partner and I took a break for this reason, and now we are stronger than ever before.

Now, there will always be triggers for us, no matter how much therapy we receive, so understanding from a partner is important. But a medical diagnosis is not an excuse to sustain an unhealthy relationship. I hope this helps.

BPD,Other,a Hostess 1,9 months,"I tried many therapies over many years and I found a DBT (dialectic behavioral therapy) residential treatment program that saved my life.

BPD,Other,a Manager 1,3 months,"I would suggest trying couples therapy first. It's likely that she is aware of these issues herself but doesn't know how to change or maybe she can feel like it's completely beyond her control. I fit some of these symptoms (especially around my period) but am very self aware and able to reason myself out of my worst fears/assumptions 95% of the time. That's due to therapy and being on Wellbutrin, and also working on sleep, nutrition, and exercise. If you try therapy together, it might open the door for her to do therapy alone and find out some of these things on her own.

BPD,Other,Accenture 1,3 months,"By having her agree to go to therapy as a condition for staying in the marriage, even if you go together at first or the entire time.

This is a touchy, not-to-be-taken-lightly diagnosis (should she actually receive that) and has major negative implications for raising children without the skills and/or medication to support improvement and more consistently maintain stability. It will also continue to shred your relationship as spouses.

Assuming you have a strong health package, get yourself (literally you alone) some EAP sessions to initially start talking or a regular therapist to start hashing out a real plan on what to do. Nothing on Fishbowl will help you with this in real life.

BPD is a nightmare without regular family therapy and treatment. Your wife needs to become self aware but it could take years of couples counseling and individual therapy on both your sides. When your kids come around i hope you have good health insurance.

As my mom gets older the hardest part is seeing her struggle with loneliness and depression and be the maker of her own turmoil. She cannot hold friends because no one wants to be with her.

You are the critical person in the situation to normalize the family‚Äôs need for external support to become stronger communicators to each other and build trust.

We'll do everything we can for him, obviously. He's also transgender so on top of the mental health things being accepted is another challenge he's faced. Testosterone treatments have helped with appearing male as well as top surgery before he went into college.

His whole life had revolved around success. Maintained a 4.3 GPA In high school in the Cambridge program. 4.1 at USC. Slippage started when he got back from summer break and it was devastating. He attends school of cinematic arts and was fired from a set...unable to concentrate even on simplest of things. Suicidal thoughts constantly now.

It took 3 months for me to hear back from an IOP with an opening and by then I was back at work. Definitely having a therapist and psychiatrist lined up will help. I was seeing my therapist 3 times a week when I first got home. Also potentially changing meds may help. I had been on one for years no problem but it no longer worked. Changing made a huge difference. I also went from 4.0+ to barely passing and that is super painful for someone who has always achieved highly. I feel that pain. Is it possible for him to continue seeing his hometown therapists? Telehealth? Mine was able to do that thankfully since I was striking out with other therapists. Just know your alls support is huge.

It‚Äôs valuable in so many ways‚Äîyour step son will get to see and hear from people with similar struggles, see those who manage them, receive encouragement, and eventually become an encourager of others. He is also young enough to perhaps get a glimpse into a future he doesn‚Äôt want, and one that he can avoid by actively managing his illness. It can help you as parents too.

BPD,Other,Accenture 2,a year,"I worked in psych hospital, usually they self medicate to mask the BPD. It‚Äôs a lifelong illness, but meds are better now than 20 years ago. Get a great counselor and a great psychiatrist. Find one you can work with and encourage your son to open up.

Hard to lose him to this, but you will have flashes of him through the year and if he can stay med compliant in stretches he should be ok. Get a family therapist for you and your wife as this will try your relationship with each other and with him. Lots of people go through it, those with a strong network of support and family therapy make it to the other side in good shape.

Strive to get him back on his own once he has coping skills and meds.

He dropped dead at 60 from heart failure because of all the stress and fear destroying his heart from all the evil things she did. My siblings and I were collateral damage and terribly harmed by her evil actions too. But she didn't care who else got hurt so long as she could hurt our dad it became her singular goal and obsession.

She mellowed out a bit in her late 50s as is usually with borderlines, but by then my dad was dead and I and my siblings childhoods were destroyed and we were given lifelong deep psychological wounds and a ton of traumatic memories.

Though the truth was that he was an incredible person and she was desperately mental ill and needed to have her children taken away from her because she was so unstable they weren't safe.

BPD,Other,a Manager 1,6 months,"PwC1 What BCG1 said is accurate. The constant gaslighting is intense. I spent most of my childhood and young adulthood doubting my memories and sanity because she constantly tried to convince me I was crazy and that my memories were false and tried to implant fake memories. When I was in my early 20s I went on a mission to obtain all the court records, police reports, medical records, and interview all the adults from my childhood to verify that my memories were real and what happened was real.

Other examples she tried to kidnap my siblings and me once when my father was going to be out of town on a business trip, so I told my dad. As punishment she refused to acknowledge my existence (I was like 9 at the time) like wouldn't feed me or care for me and made all my siblings refuse to acknowledge my existence too and would have them all call me traitor as the only interaction they had with me. That lasted for a month then she acted like I was her favorite person in the world.

Borderlines need to have a scapegoat someone on the outs they can get everyone to abuse together, when Borderlines have multiple children the scapegoat can transition between 2 or more kids. My oldest sister was the golden child. My 2nd sister was usually the scapegoat. I was usually the Lost child. And my baby sibling was usually the clown. But us younger 3 all could sometimes be the Scapegoat our roles weren't as fixed as the oldest's.

It's like constant volatility in the relationship with a Borderline. When she would approach me I never knew if she was going to give me a hug, playfully tickle me while telling me jokes, or if she was going to knock me on the ground kick me when I was down and drag me to the basement by my hair to beat me more. She could even start by like tickling and joking with me but something in her diseased mind would get triggered and then she'd start beating me because in her mind I would become some terrible POS.

She could be the most alluring, fun, incredible, entertaining, charismatic woman in the world. Like a magical fairy. But then she'd flip because you became bad in her eyes and she could be the most cruel, violent, sadistic demon like she had waltzed directly out of h3ll. I almost think having a straight up malignant narcissist mother would've been easier as at least you always know what you're getting with that.","4

BPD,Other,a Vice President 1,4 months,"Penalties for a psychologist making a diagnosis after only one hour without sufficient information can vary depending on the jurisdiction, the specific circumstances, and whether the behavior is reported and investigated. Potential penalties can include:

1. **Professional Sanctions**: The psychologist may face disciplinary action from their state licensing board, which could include suspension or revocation of their license, fines, mandatory supervision, or required additional training.

2. **Ethics Violations**: The APA can impose sanctions on its members for violating ethical guidelines, which could range from a reprimand to expulsion from the association.

3. **Legal Consequences**: If the premature diagnosis leads to harm, the psychologist could face civil lawsuits for malpractice. This could result in financial compensation to the patient and potentially damage the psychologist's professional reputation.

4. **Employment Consequences**: The psychologist's employer might take action, which could include termination of employment.

These actions are based on the ethical standards outlined in the APA's Ethics Code, particularly under sections concerning competence and the necessity of sufficient information before making professional judgments.

For more specific information, you might refer to the [APA Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct](https://www.apa.org/ethics/code) and contact your local state licensing board.",,9/20/24 14:24,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/ive-worked-with-two-therapists-and-a-psychiatrist-the-therapists-i-worked-with-for-3-months-and-4-months-the-psych-i-saw-for,6,10,171

BPD,Other,a Vice President 1,4 months,"Diagnosing bipolar disorder involves a comprehensive assessment by a licensed mental health professional, often following specific guidelines and using established diagnostic tools. Here are the steps typically involved:

1. **Clinical Interview**: The clinician conducts a thorough interview to gather information about the patient's history, symptoms, and overall functioning. This includes exploring mood changes, energy levels, behavior, sleep patterns, and any psychotic symptoms.

2. **Medical History**: The clinician reviews the patient's medical history to rule out any physical conditions that could be causing the symptoms. This may include a physical examination and lab tests.

3. **Family History**: Since bipolar disorder can have a genetic component, understanding the family history of mental health issues can be crucial.

4. **Standardized Diagnostic Tools**: The clinician may use standardized questionnaires and rating scales such as:
- **Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ)**: A screening tool that helps identify the presence of bipolar disorder symptoms.
- **Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)**: Measures the severity of manic episodes.
- **Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS)**: Assesses the severity of depressive symptoms.

5. **DSM-5 Criteria**: The diagnosis is confirmed using the criteria outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). For bipolar disorder, this includes:
- **Bipolar I Disorder**: Characterized by one or more manic episodes, possibly accompanied by major depressive episodes.
- **Bipolar II Disorder**: Characterized by one or more major depressive episodes and at least one hypomanic episode.
- **Cyclothymic Disorder**: Chronic fluctuating mood disturbance involving numerous periods of hypomanic symptoms and depressive symptoms that do not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode.
