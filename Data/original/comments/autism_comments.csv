,Autism,Author,a Seniorhr Generalist 1,a month,"How do you know about the employee disclosing it ‚Äúat every opportunity‚Äù? Is that your direct observation, or what has been relayed to you by others (ex. their manager). In the latter case, it‚Äôs possible someone‚Äôs own bias is affecting the way they‚Äôre viewing and reporting the situation. Basically, like any other ER situation, take it with a grain of salt and go in assuming you don‚Äôt know the whole story.

I‚Äôd say to approach with curiosity and care. Make the context that you‚Äôre aware this has come up recently (choose wording based on whether you directly or indirectly know) and want to check whether they need any accommodations and make sure they‚Äôre aware of that process in the event that they do. It‚Äôs possibly they‚Äôll ask for an accommodation that explains why it‚Äôs come up in conversations recently. If they don‚Äôt, you could gently press to mention that it‚Äôs been brought to your attention that it‚Äôs come up in a few conversations recently and you want to check whether that‚Äôs because they‚Äôre noticing needing an accommodation.

If the answer is still no, you could ask about their perspective on those conversations and hear their side of the story. I would NOT say anything about appearances. The fact that‚Äôs a concern that‚Äôs been raised has me more concerned about discrimination on the part of whoever raised it.",14,2024-09-19 20:28:23,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/hi-all-im-looking-for-some-advice-we-have-an-employee-that-recently-found-out-they-are-on-the-autism-spectrum-they-have-not,1.0,1.0,4.0

,Autism,Author,Authora Human Resources Manager,a month,"For clarity, this situation has been ongoing for a little over two months. I‚Äôve been told about this issue in conversation by multiple individuals that work in proximity to the EE. Also, sharing of personal information was not a habit of this EE prior to the diagnosis. I have taken an observational approach to this situation as the EE has not addressed the topic with HR. I myself have even checked in with the EE on multiple occasions prior to and following this development as the employees is still somewhat new to the org. Even when presented with opportunity, the EE has not noted anything with HR. However, I am now getting involved because the CEO is concerned that customers will discriminate against the company because of the comments being made (yes, I know that‚Äôs stupid). I‚Äôve done my best to assure the CEO of how unlikely something like this will affect customer loyalty (not that they listen). Anyways, I‚Äôd prefer to have the conversation and figure out what the EE needs, address the concerns, and hopefully contain the situation in a mindful way.","1

,Autism,Other,,a month,"I think you need to ask him why he‚Äôs sharing before telling him not to share. He may think it‚Äôs important for people to know since it may impact how he communicates or how he takes in information. It may be that he believes that his autism impacts the way he works and knowing might help others work better with him. At the end of the day, he is free to discuss his situation with whomever he chooses. Once you better understand why he‚Äôs as sharing this information, you will be in a better position to coach him. Under no circumstances is it appropriate for you to tell him not to share. That can get messy fast and would create exposure for your company. This needs to be handled with care. I‚Äôd consult with your internal counsel before having any conversation with the employee.","16

,Autism,Other,a Human Resources 2,a month,"To an extend of more context, I don't think its a bad thing for the employee to speak about their condition in some situations with customers if conversation allows, and or colleagues... Personally, I wouldn't advise the employee of who they choose to advise about the condition. Again, depending on the context of how the employee is telling the customer; might be a concern worth briefly mentioning in 1:1 sessions, but that would be the extent of limitations to the employee.","3

Until the employee formally comes to you and says to you that they are on the spectrum or that they have Autism, everything is speculation.

I have three team members that are on the spectrum and none of them put it on their applications or said anything when being hired. It was not until we got them on the job, that different things started to surface. When I went to them individually, two of them stated that they were on the spectrum. The third has not and he is experiencing performance issues that can get them terminated.

While keeping detailed notes of the situation is important, it should be noted that you would keep detailed notes on any performance issue. You cannot notate or give any indicator of a person's disability in your notes.

,Autism,Other,,a month,"I would tell the employee that you would not bring it up normally but since they had been conversing with others including customers you wanted to address it. That should help you avoid any claim of violating his medical privacy. I would then ask if his physician has given him any restrictions you would need to evaluate for accommodation. If his answer is no, reiterate to him that you expect his work to be at standard and that you would appreciate it if he doesn't share medical information with customers since it may make them uncomfortable.
If he says he needs to be accommodated ask him for a letter from his physician stipulating his restrictions. After receiving the information as a company determine what accommodations you can provide. Remember, the physician doesn't tell you how to accommodate, just what restrictions he has, for instance, if he is easily distractable and the doctor suggests a private office, the doctor is defining the accommodation which is not their role. There are many other options to deal with ""distractions"" things like desk placement, noise-canceling headphones, moving him from a highly trafficked area, etc.

My sister was a general manager of a Chuck-e-cheese. She had fertility issues and at 34 she ended up having twins. She couldn't stand the thought of allowing a daycare to raise her babies. So she quit and opened a bakery from inside her home. She made custom cakes for weddings, birthday parties, retirement parties, and other special events. On facebook it is ""Angela's Cakes"" but she is retired now.

The crazy thing is that her business (after all the expenses and taxes) made more than her annual salary. Which was a little over 100,000 per year. Her children have graduated high school and both have scholarships to universities starting this fall.

Being a mom to an autistic person often feels like a thankless, unrewarding job. Celebrate any small wins you can, and since she likely wont show she‚Äôs loving or thankful - show this with your partner (i.e. ‚Äúthank you for making her breakfast‚Äù) and develop that side of the support system. Deep down your daughter loves you, she just may not show it.
For a job, maybe she can find something using her strengths, like in a mailroom or stuffing envelopes. There are nonsocial and noncomplex jobs out there.
You‚Äôre definitively not alone. There are so many people like you out there who will be a good support system.

It was a struggle getting him through high school and I have not had much support in getting him resources for work training but I'm still working on it.

When I finally figured out the assessment through school weren't worh much, I got him tested through a psychologist, he was diagnosed with several learning disabilities, anxiety but stopped short of an autism diagnosis.

It just made me very sad that we found out that she‚Äôs nine years behind developmentally.

You might look up an Autism-related psychiatrist to help you. The diagnosis helps you to keep your child on your medical insurance past the age of 25 and also helps to give them more time on assignments and testing at school.

You could try a situation like that. To keep yourself interested and invested in conversation, you could be the one to start, about a topic you like- just make sure to engage the other person, perhaps by asking their opinion on it. Smalltalk also works, you can try eventually relating other topics into that conversation to shift the focus without dropping the chat off. You can even try this on customers first, before trying it on coworkers- if things don't go well at first, any one customer is just an occasional visitor, while a coworker will routinely be back.

When I was a cashier, I'd pick an item out of the customer's cart and make it a topic of conversation to avoid awkward silences.

,Autism,Other,The Walt Disney Company 1,10 months,"Hey there!

I have the same mental ‚Äúissues‚Äù you have but way older than you. I didn‚Äôt even know about these issues until last year.

I have been a top performer due to my diligence, conscientiousness, and openness. Sometimes I do tend to overextend myself to exhaustion (forcing myself to be in social situations even though I really just want to go home and watch Netflix or play video games)

The best advice I could give is fake it til you make it, but know your limits, which you already do.

Growth comes from getting out of your comfort zone.

When you said ‚Äúit‚Äôs very hard to convince myself to‚Äù - you have this internal argument with yourself. You said you WANT to, yet you are still in the process of ‚Äúconvincing‚Äù yourself. That to me is like ‚Äúwell even if I don‚Äôt want to I really don‚Äôt have to‚Äù

You know how muscular people get fit? It‚Äôs because they lifted weights probably 2-3x a week. They‚Äôve put in the work. They didn‚Äôt have those muscles before, but now they do.

You know how people become great at what they do, whether it‚Äôs art, science, or math? Because they‚Äôve dedicated some time and focus to hone their skills or solve problems.

Is it always enjoyable? Maybe for a few.. and by a few, perhaps less than 5% of them‚Ä¶ but the lesson here is that being ‚Äúsocial‚Äù is a skill that you can learn.

If you want a shortcut though, you can use ‚Äúnootropics‚Äù or ‚Äúmushroom coffee‚Äù or some of the racetams‚Ä¶ or psychedelics lol.

Truth of the matter is we are all wired a certain way that makes it harder for us to do some things that are easy for others. You probably have skills that are hard to do for others as well. It‚Äôs just about exploring those avenues that you haven‚Äôt explored yet - whether or not having your brain rewired by a drug, by an event, or anything that you haven‚Äôt done before.

The important thing is to remind yourself that just because you have ADHD and autism, it limits you from what you can do. You certainly can. You just need to tell yourself you‚Äôre going to do what you ‚Äúwant‚Äù to do and you‚Äôll actually do it. It‚Äôs okay to fail, just don‚Äôt quit and keep trying.",3,2024-09-19 20:30:12,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/im-a-19-year-old-with-high-anxiety-and-depression-as-well-as-a-mentally-disabled-individual-namely-adhd-and-autism-im-generally,1.0,4.0,139.0

,Autism,Other,KPMG 1,10 months,"Yet you do. Everyone and their mom is self-diagnosing, which does not take away from the <5% of us which have been diagnosed for a long time by a psychiatrist because our childhood experiences were fundamentally different and more challenging than our peers. Shit just doesn't click the same in this funky old brain of mine. That can be a superpower but also brings a lot of isolation.

Knowing that my mirror neurons are less active, and that my brain is not functioning the same, helps me to understand why I face these challenges. That is then the starting point to work on them, not to accept it and ask others to facilitate my mental disabilities √† la TikTok in 2023.

I have moved on the spectrum through learned behaviors, and my symptoms are far less debilitating after 10+ years of intense cognitive behavioral therapy. Had I not been diagnosed and received that guidance, I would not even have finished high school.

Don't just disregard people who say they are autistic with those comments. It's a bit of a trigger for sure, hence this rant, but it fits in our usual experience - functioning in society does not come to neurodiverse people the same way as it does to you, nor do you understand that, let alone the biological reason as to why we are so different.","5

Those of us who know our diagnoses are better set up to create a life that works best for our needs and skills. OP, knowing yourself is the first step!

But, they did nothing to ‚Äúbe like this‚Äù and they don‚Äôt know any better. The best thing you can do as a parent is get them the help they need and show them unconditional love, regardless of the outcome.

Also - fwiw Elon musk is autistic. It‚Äôs not always a bad thing. It‚Äôs just different.

I can send you a plethora of peer-reviewed studies if you would like which prove at least some correlation and given the vaccine schedule has gone from like 8 to 56‚Ä¶. You can draw your own conclusions but I‚Äôve made my decision going forward.","2

,Autism,Other,Michigan Elementary School 1,9 months,"Of course they‚Äôre loved. I wasn‚Äôt referring to, what love has to do with it. ASD is a true spectrum and can have many comorbid diagnosis that go with it. Is it everyday, no! But we have an entire lifespan of services for our more severely disabled ASD students , who are loved by their family very deeply. We service Early On (infant) through transition services age 26. These students have a job coach the works.

I hope all parents love their child whether that child is ASD or not. And Early intervention always helps but it‚Äôs no cure sometimes. That‚Äôs been my experience working with ASD kids, that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying.

Also vaccinations have been studied to death- there‚Äôs no correlation. They‚Äôre finding a specific gene is the culprit. Autism is highly heritable: It is estimated at least 50% of genetic risk is predicted by common genetic variation and another 15-20% is due to spontaneous mutations or predictable inheritance patterns.

,Autism,Other,an Associate Attorney 1,9 months,"Did you even read it?! It says what I‚Äôm saying!

First this is purely anecdotal of one loser that was too poor to get test accommodations. She only had 3 notes from two years prior, which means she tried to get this done WHILE she was in law school. She had ZERO records or letters from a psychologist or psychiatrist. She had a PCP and NP letter, that‚Äôs it. Oh, and she spent only $10,000 overall, because she waited until the 11th hour. She‚Äôs a lazy turd. The rich people get started early when the children are in primary or middle school. They spend ten times that amount of decades.

,Autism,Other,a Transcriptionist 1,5 months,"That's a very tough situation to be in, for you and for the children. I worked from home for quite a few years from the time I became a single parent when my children were 2 and 5, until they were teenagers and I trusted them to come home and be alone for a couple of hours until I got back from work. The early years were tough because I had such young kids. The 5 year old was in 1/2 day kindergarten Monday to Friday, and the 2 year old was in an all-day program one day a week, so they were around me for half the day at least. I managed it by working in chunks of time throughout the day. I would read to them or play with them for an hour and then work for an hour while they continued playing alone. I worked while they napped in the afternoon for a couple of hours. It's definitely not an easy thing to do. Many times they would sit under my desk and play with Lego or their dolls. Sometimes I would spend half an hour with them in the kitchen making a batch of play-doh, then leave them to play with it while I worked. The majority of my work in those early years was done at night, after they went to bed. Schooling at home might work the same way - you'd have to spend time going over the day's lesson and then do some of your work while they were doing the assignment for the day's material. Then onto the next subject, teach the lesson, then work while they do their assignment. If you can get into a regular routine, you can manage. It will mean working evenings, sometimes into the early morning hours, and probably need to do some work on Saturday and Sunday as well, but that's the trade-off if you want to have them at home. If you can afford to hire someone to come in for even half-days to monitor the kids while they're doing school work, that would give you four solid hours to work without interruption.",3,2024-09-19 20:34:00,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/has-anyone-been-able-to-successfully-juggle-working-from-home-while-your-child-does-virtual-school-i-mean-we-all-did-it-during,1.0,13.0,282.0

As long as you‚Äôre understanding what is expected from you and you‚Äôre doing your job well - things will be good with the right company. I think having a good relationship and understanding with your boss is KEY. Seeking a good company with a culture who foster professionalism and acceptance. People always appreciate positivity; that mixed with a genuine personality, you can never go wrong! So offer positivity, if you can. Most importantly - be true to yourself. Everyone has to find their right fit. Autism or not. And without knowing you. A medium sized company vs a larger one may be better suited as management and other staff are less likely to be overworked and have more time to be engaging with other employees. I don‚Äôt have autism but I have family members who do. Autism or not. Everyone is different with certain set of strengths and skill sets. Ask people who know you best, what are your best attributes?

Unfortunately, you cannot really ‚Äòcontrol‚Äô genetics. Unless maybe there are tests you could do on an embryo before implantation with IVF but I‚Äôm not sure exactly what conditions they test for with those. Other than that it is just testing both partners to get a statistical probability.

There are also podcasts specifically for sleep, one is called ‚Äúsleep with me‚Äù, where a guy just rambles about nothing for hours. I heard about one where someone reads an ikea product catalog, and there are some dry bedtime stories.

If that doesn‚Äôt work, get out of bed, have a glass of milk or water and read a book in another room. This might help shift the mind - if not quiet it.

Last resort, just get up and get ready to go. If you‚Äôre ready early, get a nap in last minute. And avoid caffeine so you can also try to nap in flight.

Being frustrated or stressed about not sleeping the surefire way not to get sleep. Know that one night of lost sleep isn‚Äôt going to ruin your day.

,Autism,Other,null High School 1,7 months,"good to learn of your new passion for supporting others, and your decision to pursue Early Childhood Education with SPEC/Autism certifications is commendable. Regarding your inquiry about the optimal timing for applying to public schools, several factors warrant consideration.
1. Credentials and Accreditation Requirements: Before submitting applications, it's crucial to understand the specific credentials or accreditations required by public schools in your area. Conduct thorough research to ensure you meet these prerequisites. If additional measures are necessary, address them proactively.

2. Internship Timing and Hiring Cycles: Consider the timing of your internship in relation to the school hiring cycles. If your internship concludes before the hiring period begins, consider applying early. This approach increases your chances of securing a position and ensures a smooth transition post-internship.

3. Extended Internship Period: Conversely, if your internship extends into the hiring season, exercise patience. Focus on successfully completing your internship, gaining valuable experience, and obtaining strong references. Waiting until the internship concludes may be prudent.the decision is personal and depends on your career aspirations at the end of the day. good luck",1,2024-09-19 21:34:28,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/i-have-decided-to-change-my-major-from-aba-to-early-childhood-education-with-specautism-certificates-right-now-i-am-a-mentor,1.0,35.0,60.0

There are specific diets and supps you can use as an intervention and see if they help. Another great source is Christopher Palmer, a Harvard Psychiatrist. They have written books and are active on ig.

In short, get your diet in check (eat clean, whole foods, fermented food like sauerkraut, kefir or kimchi, a lot of protein, fish, eggs, red meat, fruits and veggies), do weight training at least 3 times a week, meditate, explore breathwork (works magic if you‚Äôre consitent - look into wim hof breathing or psychological sight), expose your eyes to the sun especially in the morning‚Ä¶

Because some therapists don't do the medication side of things and that what insurance companies are afraid of.

,Autism,Other,a Staff Software Engineer 1,6 months,"Therapists are usually professional psychologists. Psychologists are not licensed physicians - which means they can't prescribe medications, and are limited in what diagnoses they can make (and their diagnoses won't always be accepted by physicians, especially when it comes to prescribing medications).

To get a diagnosis that will be broadly accepted, you will need to get the testing done by a psychiatrist, which is a physician with specialized training in psychiatric conditions (including ADHD and autism).

A lot of health insurance plans require you to see your primary care doctor for a referral before seeing a specialist of any sort. It's a cost saving measure for them, if your primary care doctor doesn't think it's necessary they're supposed to say no (plus it adds a step and so some people just won't bother).

,Autism,Other,a Registered Nurse 2,5 months,"This might be long but stick with me. I am a nurse with autism. Sometimes I feel like the psychosocial has held me back at times but I really have made it work in my favor and I have developed tricks along the way. The most difficult thing for me is making eye contact with people and saying few words; I'm very to the point. My first interactions with people I make a conscious effort to look people in the eye and respond appropriately; which does take practice, try practicing with friends or family with social interactions. After a few interactions they usually talk to me while I'm working, so it is an excuse not to look them in the eye and usually no one brings it up.

As for what I do. I work in home healthcare, working with children/young adults with intellectual disabilities and usually autism; most are nonverbal. A lot of these individuals have underlying medical issues, most notably are g-tubes. I have a great ability to read body language and nonverbal cues which is great to have in my job. I am also great at routine, which these individuals tend to crave. I have been thinking about working in a group home but that's another conversation.

In short: practice social interactions with people you are comfortable with and you can even ask them what you may need to work on. Find your strengths, find your niche, find a job that suits you. The first person said informatics. There are many different kinds of nursing jobs out there, do some research. I hope this helps and be the best nurse you can be.",7,2024-09-19 21:44:59,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/any-nurses-with-autism-what-area-of-healthcare-do-you-practice-in-do-you-have-any-tips-for-a-new-ish-grad-2-years-experience,1.0,50.0,27.0

School nursing is nice for this. You have your own office to yourself. You only see kids one at a time, and you don't have anyone in your space, like coworkers. Small talk is minimal.

Employers do not always share our tendency toward loyalty. They are often aware of how to manipulate us. Try not to take it personally. It is not a shortcoming on our part. Just a different connection. If you are like me, you love the code. Some people like the money they make from our passions too.

Not all anyone, of course, but greed and exploitation seem a little more free and easy these days, unfortunately.

I‚Äôm sorry this happened to you. But nothing is *wrong* with you. We are all born perfect, with our own strengths and weaknesses. Nature decides. We just have to roll with the hand we are dealt.

I was diagnosed with ADHD in my 30s, and it looks like I went for the high score on self-tests for ASD just a few months back (nearly 20 years later - let‚Äôs say I missed some jokes over the years). We all had to adapt to things kids today are lucky to get help with (if they can even get in for diagnosis). A menagerie of coping mechanisms. Considering we were often misunderstood and even punished because of neurodiversity, the fact that we can find cool work we are good at and each other for support, we are doing okay‚Ä¶.mostly.",,2024-09-19 22:02:51,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/known-something-was-wrong-with-me-as-far-back-as-i-can-remember-some-exceptional-abilities-stem-but-serious-deficits,1.0,92.0,30.0

,Autism,Other,a Consultant 1,2 months,"I know things were delayed post-COVID for autism clinical diagnosis, but I wasn‚Äôt aware of wait times for ABA. I think it should be similar for all states, but I have heard that CO, NY, NJ, and MA are very supportive states for kids with special needs. Early intervention is most helpful in the case of autism, so I would recommend getting added to the waitlist of the center you like and, in parallel, enrolling wherever they have a slot. You can cold call ABA centers and ask them if they have availability. Along with ABA, speech therapy, OT, and PT might also be helpful. Lastly, check out this book, which teaches how to manage behavior issues.

No intention of disclosing at work for me.

I know others do, but I don‚Äôt see what the benefit would be for me, personally. Although I do think many of my colleagues would think: ‚Äúah, so that‚Äôs what it is!‚Äù

Part two of your question is if it‚Äôs worth getting diagnosed as an adult. I think there‚Äôs something to say for having an answer, but if you‚Äôre reasonably confident enough and the alternative is to spend thousands of dollars (assuming US) to get a sheet of paper that says it then it‚Äôs your call.

There are some online fora where you can find this question explored - no real consensus but frankly that community is what gives me what I need so I don‚Äôt feel so alone.",2,2024-09-19 22:27:04,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/question-for-anyone-with-autism-spectrum-disorder-asd-how-has-a-diagnosis-helped-you-especially-at-work-i-suspect-i-have,1.0,108.0,53.0
