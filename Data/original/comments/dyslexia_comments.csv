I’m dyslexia in English but no problem with Japanese). 100% understand what you are talking about. I had to triple check my work before sending out to partners, and sometimes there are still a handful of typos. A couple tips might be helpful:
1. Use Arial, Calibri, or any less crowded fonts when you draft things, and convert back to New Times Roman before sending out;
2. Align left when you draft so the space between each word is standardized, and justify before sending out;
3. Put two spaces between sentences (I know people have different thoughts about this, but it works for me so there you go);
4. Point your finger at/under each word when you proofread, and move your finger as you read; and
5. Use numbering not bullets when you make a list.
