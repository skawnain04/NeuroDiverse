OCD,Other,an Associate Attorney 1,9 months,"The game is rigged. I have Apergers, but I am extremely high functioning. I got DOUBLE TIME on all my exams in college and in law school, SAT and LSAT, MPRE, AND THE BAR EXAM.

I have a stack of paperwork of over 300 pages going back to when I was 4 years old from doctors. It‚Äôs not hard at all. It‚Äôs a fucking pain in the god damn ass to gather up all the paperwork and organize it in a pretty little bow though. Took me about six months.

‚Ä¶And it was all bullshit. I‚Äôm not retarded. I don‚Äôt need the extra time , quite the opposite. The game is rigged. I was born with a silver spoon very far up my ass.

All the rich people can afford doctors for their children so they can get diagnosed with bullshit. The rich people get extra time, which is what makes those exams hard in the first place‚Äînot enough time. It‚Äôs modern day Jim Crowe. People talk about white male privilege and all kinds of garbage. But this is REAL privilege‚Äîrich privilege.

The half that pass the bar exam are all the rich people. It has nothing to do with whomever can afford the fancy prep classes, it‚Äôs all about the extra time.


Then you get out into the real world. Give an ADA accommodation request letter to your employer and you‚Äôre pretty much bullet proof. They can‚Äôt ever fire you‚Äîless they get sued.

I sued an employer for firing me for discrimination. I got $80,000. Though as you can tell by my post, it was probably because I am an asshole.

OCD,Other,Authoran Associate,9 months,"I have been in therapy since I was 16 (30 now). I have both diagnosed OCD, ADHD/ASD, and Depression. I have been on Prozac for 14 years with stings of non-medicated months.

OCD is considerably easier to keep in check with higher dosages of SSRIs. View medication as a means to lower the ‚Äúbaseline‚Äù level of symptoms. There will still need to be skills learned to compensate for the rest - that is where CBT and DBT come in to play. If you wish to not take medicine then I would explore those options first. Just know, I am not aware of anyone truly OCD that has had luck with just those.

May I ask why you are opposed to medicine?

ERP (plus CBT and some DBT skills) have been working so far, albeit slowly, to improve both OCD and depression. My OCD specialist reports that not all patients benefit from medication. So I am curious if others also found a non-medication route to health and what that looks like. (I‚Äôm of course working with a psychiatrist.)","2

OCD,Other,a Strategy Consultant 1,4 months,"Currently at EYP, I have a mixed view. For the most part, I kind of agree. However, there are ex-MBB/T2 partners which bring in quality work where you‚Äôd get good exposure. I‚Äôve first-hand seen us win a few proposals competing against K/OW/MBB, though we usually compete on a cost basis rather than quality.

The other draw is if you‚Äôre originally e.g. American (where EYP is a strong brand) and you weren‚Äôt competitive enough in the US to land a solid strategy consulting gig, doing EYP in MENA for a year or two is honestly not a bad idea. It‚Äôs not like US recruiters could tell re the relatively unestablished presence of EYP in the region lol.

Aside from all that, I‚Äôve seen people start at EYP and end up at OW/K/MBB.
