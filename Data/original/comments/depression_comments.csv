Bipolar,Other,an Executive Assistant 1,7 months,"When I was laid off my computer screen went dark 2 minutes later! Lol! I was told I was lucky to get 1 month of severance. I was laid off literally after recruiting 2 people I’ve worked with in the past. I will never do that again. It’s painful but the lessons I learned are priceless. You will find a better job! I’m pretty happy where I am now, but I interview a few times a month just to see what’s out there and make connections. We live in a world where we can never be too comfortable! Best of luck to you!",6,9/18/24 20:19,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/i-got-laid-off-yesterday-and-was-wondering-if-i-had-to-workim-responsible-for-2-kids-and-need-to-quickly-find-a-job-within-45,1,1,1
Bipolar,Other,Infosys 1,7 months,"There are a couple of things, if you got two kids it isn't really about how you feel. The fact that they are even giving you a 1.5 month notice is a blessing. Most don't get that.

Unfortunately you have little ones that need you so you sort of have to suck it up and use most of your time searching for a job. They are literally paying you to look for another job. When kids are involved your feelings don't matter anymore. That's what you sign up for when you have kids.",6,9/18/24 20:19,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/i-got-laid-off-yesterday-and-was-wondering-if-i-had-to-workim-responsible-for-2-kids-and-need-to-quickly-find-a-job-within-45,1,1,2

Bipolar,Other,a Program Director 1,7 months,"They’ve given you 1.5 months notice. Consider yourself lucky - not many companies do that. They are not obliged to give you any notice. And if they are paying you, then they do expect you to work.

Consider this, you are getting 1.5 months plus the severance package period to actively start searching for a job. In current market, it will take you 1-2 months optimistically to spruce up your resume, share it with your connects, apply for jobs. And that does not take more than 1-2 hours every day.

So instead of brooding about current working environment and what’s happened, just do what is necessary and focus on the future.

Good luck!","19

Don't act bitter or out of spite, it will come back to bite you in the butt! Stay getting your resume out there, apply for allot of jobs! You're in SALES now, you are your product! You may get hired tomorrow or interview for a job that won't make an offer for 3 months! That's your new reality.

Bipolar,Other,a Senior Product Manager 1,7 months,"Being laid off is hard to swallow. My thought, break it down into steps

1. Breathe and process with the help of your therapist
2. Ask if your therapist is willing to go to 2x a week, work on recentering techniques like meditation to help get through the rough moments
3. Set small achievable goals. Draft one bullet of your resume every day for a week. Send the draft through ChatGPT for review/edit. Even ask GPT to make your bullets for you in the first place.
4. Celebrate finishing the resume with a favorite food, hobby, exercise class, something
5. Apply to 1 job every 3 days.
6. Reach out to 1 person for networking every 3 days.
7. Picture a healthier, happier workplace. Remember the severance means you get to have a month or two to recover before touching your savings.
8. Lean on your loved ones and family for emotional support","11

Bipolar,Other,a Strategic Investment Analyst 1,4 months,"Technical Associate 1 No I did not say that. I was just asking. Networking does not work for everyone especially if you do not know the person. How can someone refer you to a position if they really do not know anything about you both personally and professionally? A lot of people who try to network on LinkedIn are ignored most of the time because the person either sees them as competition, they just do not want to help them because no one did the same for them, etc. Also reaching out to a recruiter or hiring manager on LinkedIn will not work as well because they will think you are trying to get an advantage over other candidates. They will tell you to apply on the career website, but will filter you out when you apply so your application is in the rejection pile. Yes people do get high-paying jobs all the time through an online application. They just have to know how to pass the ATS system and stand out when it comes to the recruiter and hiring manager with unique skills and very impressive resume.","3

Bipolar,Author,a Financial Planning and Analysis Manager 1,4 months,"I am facing a similar decision, but brought on by a personal matter that is requiring significant time off work. I am curious about the range of responses here.

I would say, just from things I have reflected on in deciding to do something similar, take time to focus on yourself if you need to and can afford it. Unfortunately most of us will have to work for many more years if not decades.

Bipolar,Other,a Manager 2,a year,"This is a great distinction BCG is making. Medication can definitely help establish that floor, but life happens, and that's where situational depression/ anxiety comes into play. When it's circumstance that's driving your mood, you need to be really mindful of selecting your thoughts and reframing the stories you tell yourself (we are our worst critics, after all). Therapy is a great place to learn those skills. Don't just go for talk therapy and rehash your day-to-day - tell a prospective therapist that you want to focus on skills development. Build skills first, then you'll be equipped to unpack whatever else is there.","8

Bipolar,Other,Accenture 1,a year,"M2, this is very thoughtful and well thought out advice. I’d go one step further though… therapists and psychiatrists failed me massively when I was a younger adult so I refuse to revisit that route. Had certain events in my own life plus my father’s death I was present for that fully brought everything back into perspective for me.

Sometimes in life with experience and age, things happen that force you to reckon with just who you are, what you have, what fortunate circumstances you are in versus so many others that will teach you somehow how to give back, pay it forward. I could sit here and play victim for the rest of my life or I could break free from that mentality and say, I know I was meant for something bigger, greater, I was meant to help those younger than me do greater than I ever could.

There is no denying chemistry as SP1 states and I fully agree with that, always have. Many of us just need that help with certain deficiencies to make certain reactions happen.

Bipolar,Other,an Associate Creative Director 3,4 months,It’s creative agencies that are getting gutted but “advertising” is doing just fine. That’s why there’s no story for the press. No one cares about ad people. People are too wealthy and the work is annoying to general population for it to be covered.

But unless you’ve been hiding under a rock, even the people who have jobs are scared of losing them and have already survived 3 rounds of layoffs. Also, this isn’t exclusive to our industry.

Bipolar,Other,a Senior Manager 1,7 months,"@MD1, i talked about it with my primary care doc and he referred me to a psychiatrist. I went through the full evaluation with him and got the formal diagnosis, which he sent to my doc. Then I talked about treatment options with my doc and decided to go with meds. Relatively seamless and interesting process.","2

Bipolar,Other,a Business Development 1,7 months,"SM1 how do you feel taking the meds now. Granted it’s been over 15 years since taking anything but, I refused to because I felt like a shell of myself. I’ve made it pretty well on my own without them but due to market changes I’ve had to shut down my company and pivot to a corporate role and fear that I’ll need them to function like a “normal” person. Also +1 for recommending this, I was in a severe depression and realized the majority of it stemmed from my ADD. I feel most people don’t realize that it can cause this and end up perpetually miserable.","1

Bipolar,Other,a Senior Manager 1,7 months,"BD1, I honestly feel great and like a renewed person. I say renewed vs new because I still feel like myself, but now I’m back in control, have a renewed sense of purpose, and feel like I can finally reach my potential again and actually contribute what I know I always could, but was held back by ADD and the follow on effects it caused. I used to take Aderall, but like you I got off of it thinking I could manage without it now that I was done with school. That worked for a while, but after changing jobs then post-COVID things started going down hill. Took me too long IMO to realize it was ADD rearing its ugly head. This time I started taking Vyvanse instead of Aderall, which wasn’t around back then. So far it’s been much better than Aderall…it lasts longer, more even, and not really any crash or negative side effects. It took a few in person meetings to get the hang of socializing on it, but after a week or so I’m good to go. I wish I would’ve done this sooner.","2

Bipolar,Other,a Business Development 1,7 months,"Not speaking for SM1 but from personal experience yes. There was a crippling lack of motivation, near paralysis, and procrastination. I knew exactly what needed to be done, I’m exceptional at what I do, had all the tools to do it and couldn’t get myself to move an inch, frozen. With that came the self hatred and deeper depression. Research and talking with a therapist pointed towards ADD.","2

Bipolar,Other,a Senior Manager 1,7 months,"BA1, my situation was pretty much 100% what BD1 just described. Exactly that. The paralysis part is spot on and is the most frustrating part of it. You know what needs to get done, and if you did it you have the ability to do it well, but you just….can’t. It started at work then bled into personal life like taking care of home projects, etc. Eventually the self hatred, zero motivation, endless procrastination, all that got so bad I had to take action. For me, knowing I had ADD in the past was what led me to treat that first. If I hadn’t had experience managing ADD years ago I probably would have sought treatment for depression first. Luckily, so far my new ADD treatment has also alleviated the depression-like symptoms as well as the focus, drive, mental clarity piece of ADD. So long way of saying, yes in my case at least, ADD manifested depression.","1

Bipolar,Other,a Business Analyst 1,7 months,"Senior Manager 1, that was helpful. A few more queries. When and how did you diagnose it was ADD ? School years ? Or did you do well in school and college and then you tapered off with career/family/pressure etc. In my case I was a get goer in college (though someone had to push me for several years to be motivated to do good but I wasnt bottom but average). But with push I had the fire to perform top class and do my very best on my own through college. And after a year of career in consulting, the pressure/competition etc hit me and I felt depressed. That pattern has been there always. Some days I am all charged up but otherwise its mostly depression to clueless,procrastinating because of anxiety, afraid of future etc etc. Recently I came upon ADHD youtube videos and thought it sounds like me. I took some medications for depression but felt it made it worse or didnt help, sometimes felt more depressed.
Regarding medication are you on Vynase or Adderall. Lastly is there any truth that medications can affect brain and in long run make you dependent plus the effects taper out and you are left with no solution ? I have read that ADHD without hyper is lack of motivation which is lack of frontal lobe activity and natural way to get it is exercise and get dopamine. Much thanks, your replies help.",,9/18/24 20:23,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/has-anyone-ever-been-let-go-due-to-depression-related-performance-issues-i-havent-been-able-to-proverbially-get-myself,11,6,335
Bipolar,Other,a Senior Manager 1,7 months,"BA1, glad to hear sharing my experience is helpful. Always happy to elaborate. I was diagnosed at the end of high school. I was always a bright but under performing student in grade school and never really had the motivation to apply myself. I was hyperactive as a kid and tried Ritalin early on but it didn’t help so my parents took me off it. Once I was 18 I took it upon myself to get medical advice for ADD and was prescribed Adderall. It was game changer. I thrived in college and grad school, making mostly As throughout and gaining all the academic accolades and all that. After grad school I stopped taking it thinking I only needed it to get through school activities that require intense concentration and self motivation. In the work environment the stress and pressure of competition was a huge motivator for me and I think that helped me manage some of the ADD symptoms. It wasn’t until I switched to a less stressful industry job and started WFH during Covid did the ADD effects kick back in and things went down hill from there.

I’m on Vyvanse now, which I like better than Adderall. Fewer side effects and seems to work better overall. Regarding your last points, I can give you my two cents based on what my doctor and psychiatrist told me, so definitely consult a real expert, but like any medication your body will adapt to it and the full effects may subside a bit, but there’s ways to mitigate that (eg increased dosage, using a mix of regular and extended release, switching between medicines, taking a few days off on the weekends, etc). Exercise and other non-meds options do help, but for me it only helped temporarily. As soon as I came down from the dopamine spike from exercise, i went back into the ADD hole. The medicine keeps you level all day with no spikes and dips. My docs said the Hyperactivity part of ADHD often goes away as you get older as an adult, but the attention deficit part can stay with you. I’m not sure about the long term affects of the meds on the brain, but my plan is to keep my brain active through learning, reading, challenging new things, etc, which is all made possible by the medication helping me better use my brain. I figured I’d be more likely to go insane by having my brain constantly going 120% in 200 different directions all day everyday than actually having clear thoughts and accomplishing what I want to do in life.

Re the lack of motivation part, to me at least, I’ve always been highly motivated and driven to achieve and get things done….but ADD has a way of paralyzing you where you can’t actually take any steps to do what you want to do or do what you know needs to be done. For people who have never experienced that, it’s hard to explain and empathize with so you’re called lazy, unmotivated, etc. I can totally understand now how folks with deep depression must feel, and it’s brutal. But the good news for my case of ADD, for now at least, that dark cloud and paralysis was lifted literally on day one of medication. I can’t describe that feeling of having control of your brain and life. Like, is this how “normal” people feel all the time? Omg.","1

Bipolar,Author,Authora Senior Associate,7 months,"BA1 Not to detract from anyone whose issue really is ADD/ADHD, but just just an FYI-- I have very, very similar symptoms. ADD, BPD, and CPTSD (probably among others) can have many overlapping symptoms especially when depression is in play.

I also lack motivation. I can't force myself to do even the simplest tasks now, and have been fighting a crippling depression for what feels like too long. I was also a go-getter in college and an insufferable overachiever during my first few years with the firm, then I descended into becoming what feels like one of the most useless people alive.
I haven't even opened any of my mail since last May. I zone out during all my meetings now.
The fall from grace was not a pretty one.
But I do not have, nor have had, any substantial experiences with ADD/ADHD. My focus is lacking, but not for that reason.

I only say this because during my desperation to explain how I ended up this way, I'd also entertained the idea that I'd somehow developed a form of ADD. But the more I thought about it... the more I realized that this simply wasn't it. And once again, I was left demoralized without answers. If it is ADD for you then I pray for your victory on that path, but if it's not, I hope you don't lose hope like I had in that moment when I realized that it wasn't the answer.

Almost everyone will suggest antidepressants to help with CPTSD, but they didn't do crap for me (Citalopram/Bupropion) and we don't all have enough time to figure out what does and doesn't work because the degree of severity varies between everyone, and some clinicians are downright crap. For me, this is becoming a battle of not only the mind, but the heart, because I am simply out of time for trial and error with external sources now. And honestly, if unresolved trauma is the issue, medication may only ever be a bandaid solution.

Even a productive machine can overheat and break if used for too long, or if used under improper conditions. And if said machine had even an ounce of the intricacy and care that it took to design you, then it would have a safety measure built into it to prevent it from overheating... such as stopping all processes deemed to be contributing to the issue.
It's easy to confuse this safety feature for damage, thinking the machine is broken just because it's not running, but that's not always the case.
And I realized... that's what was happening to me. I hate this job. This isn't the life I wanted to live. I feel trapped.

After finally allowing myself to acknowledge that I had unresolved traumas, no matter how seemingly mundane, I was able to start understanding my own inexplicable behavior more by looking up how people with trauma think and react.
And so I looked at how I was procrastinating, and when.
I have a new task at work. Start it now........ or play a game on my phone for hours which will make me more miserable later? Or watch a movie? Or watch a show? Or sleep?
This was how I'd learned to comfort myself when going through the worst days of my life as a kid. Parents fighting? Watch a show. Issues at school? Play a game that fosters redemption. Tired? Sleep.
Ignore it.
Avoid it.
Escape.
This was what my body had learned to do in times of overwhelming stress.
This was my safety feature, and it started to switch on whenever something work related came up because my work was linked to my misery.

Unfortunately, it's looking like the only quick solution for me is to quit and do what I actually want to do, but as the only breadwinner of my family, how can I?

I really hope you're able to find a solution that works for you, whether it be medication, time off, a job change, or even just coming to terms with who and where you are, but as for me... I'm just looking for a way to turn off the safety feature so I can force the machine to keep running, because the world doesn't stop just because I do. But you can look for external ways to cool down your machine if you have the time to go shopping for one that will actually work.

Lastly, if you're anything like me... try to find a way to meaningfully comfort yourself, or find someone who can, and will. And try not to be so mean to or critical of your inner child, because even though you may think it's self sabotage, it's really just trying to help you in the only way that it knows how.","3

I'm not sure where you are located. But Washington (the state) offers a free service called WorkSource. You don't have to live in Washington to use it.

Their Strategies for Success series has saved my life. My depression skyrocketed when I lost my job unexpectedly. The things they teach, the non-judgemental teachers, the other people attending the classes; gave me a much needed social community and stepping stones to get a reprieve from the crushing depression.

It's all virtual so you can join via zoom or phone. You can register here https://worksourcewa.com/microsite/content.aspx?appid=WAWORKSHOPS&pagetype=simple&seo=virtual

It's 6 modules. 4 days a week, 3 hours a day. You don't have to do them in order, or you can just do one (I'd recommend the Health and Wellness, and the Personal Strength Builders modules).

I do hope you can find something that re-lights your spark. The depression is crippling and it takes so much energy just survive the next day, hour, minute it makes it feel impossible to reach out beyond that next step, next breath. I understand the struggle intimately.

Depression,Other,a Therapist 1,9 months,"It's important that you get and 'shake yourself off' and keep going. Mental headspace is paramount. I'd start with Amazon, they ALWAYS need good people. They're a good company, and the robust nature of work will keep you busy and physically fit. I wouldn't make friends, but do your own thing, stay in your own lane, an be humble about whatever it is they ask, because you are busy, have something you are accountable to, and must be there. You will have no idea how God will see your faith, what time you're showing up, not calling off, and Amazon keeps the clock. Distraction cures reaction to idolness of mind, staying mindful and focused, and making an honest living for yourself. Life is indeed a highway, and your friends are busy with life too, so you gotta make it for you! Happiness is having a sense of purpose in anything you do.

Depression,Other,a Consultant 4,9 months,"It’s incredibly ignorant advice PWC1. I pity you. OP, please ignore PWC1 and anyone with advice like that. No quality professional therapist would advise this. You have a mental illness that needs strategic coping mechanisms. I hope you continue working with your medical professional to learn more tools that help when times are tough. Be honest with them about how you’re feeling and they should be able to equip you with the right treatment modality that supplements any medication you’re on, or help to prescribe better medication for your changing circumstances. Depression isn’t one size fits all, even within the same person. It changes with every phase of your life and you can adapt to it with the right help. Best of luck to you. It isn’t easy by any means but it can get better.","3

Depression,Other,a Managing Director 2,9 months,"Exercise, eating well, and avoiding alcohol are big. You’ll need to ignore those who say “get over it,” which are usually people with their own issues and need to feel superior to others without understanding or being helpful. Everyone is different, so I recommend trying different approaches and finding out what works for you. I’ve managed depression and suicidal ideation for nearly thirty years. Anti-dep meds helped me bridge out of really dark depression but didn’t serve me well as a permanent solution—just emotionally numbed me. Instead, having a morning routine with exercise to get moving, having a vacation to look forward to, and being social while also recognizing when I needed solo downtime just to relax helped. Several ideas: try out different types of therapy, going for daily walks, journaling/meditation, and not defaulting to escapism through 80+hrs of weekly high-performance work/activities.","7

Depression,Other,a Director 2,9 months,"I think the point is that clinical depression is more than just wallowing in self pity, and it’s more than just feeling sad. A lot of people with clinical depression don’t even feel sad, just…numb. But it’s the fatigue, brain fog, trouble focusing, inexplicable loss of interest in your favorite things, etc that impact you, especially at work.

It took a long time for me to seek help, because I wasn’t sad so it couldn’t possibly have been depression, right? I loved my life, and sure there was a lot of stress, but I grew up very British and “keep calm and carry on” is very deeply engrained in me. Everybody has stress, you just have to grind through, and all that. But I couldn’t shake the feeling of what I can only describe as a very heavy, wet blanket draped over my brain, like I was stuck in a pit of molasses mentally and physically. This job is really, really hard to do when you feel like that, which only compounds the feeling.

OP, give yourself some grace. Time off helped me reset and prioritize the things that helped me feel better— getting outside more consistently, taking walks, etc. Meds helped as a way to get over the hump so that I had the energy to exercise, cook well, etc again. I realized that constantly being in overdrive was exacerbating the issue and reassessed what kind of day-to-day lifestyle I wanted.

Hang in there— you’ve got this.","4

Depression,Other,a Manager 3,9 months,"PwC1 my family was the same as yours. They also believed that you could just toughen up and power through it. Mind over matter and all that. When I was 8 and my family found out my uncle was SAing me instead of taking me to get help they instead told me to toughen up and push past it, but they did let me start drinking to help take the edge off. For the next decade I just drank or used to push my bad thoughts away. I still performed well in school uppers to get me going in the morning booze and downers to help me sleep I got really good at figuring out the correct ratios so I didn't accidently stop my heart from beating unless I wanted to, but my little brother had a habit of always finding me before I succeeded.

By the time I was 18 my body was falling apart and I was suicidal. I went against every single thing my family taught me and you're advocating for, I asked for help. I stopped drinking and drugging and working and exercising all my feelings away and I asked for help. I got clean. I got sober. I got mentally better. I could never have will powered my way out of my addictions, trauma, and depression I needed help and I'm glad I asked for it and got it.

Depression,Other,a Senior Manager 2,9 months,"High functioning depressive here. What really helped me is figuring out the things/ tools I can use to get me out of a low mood on any given day. Mine are meditation, journaling, act of service, gratitude journal, afternoon walk, exercise, social interaction, healthy eating, hydration. I physically wrote them down on a sheet of paper with days of the week as the header and I would tick of the ones that I do on any given day. If I start feeling down, I look at the list and go do one of the activities. On especially bad days I try to do all of them but to be honest most days I would only need to do 4/5 to feel ok.
I did this for a few weeks and then these activities started lifting my mood bit by bit until the point where I felt I no longer needed the schedule. When I felt like I was starting to dip back into depression, I went back to the schedule to keep myself accountable and again once I got back into the rhythm of things I stopped using it. I kept the paper on my coffee table so it’s within view and keeps me accountable but checking off the items also gave me motivation to do them.
On the side I’ve also been seeing a therapist weekly but you need both talk therapy and activities to get out of the low mood and I feel the activities bit can be the more challenging one because of the lack of motivation. That’s why the schedule was very helpful.",4,9/20/24 14:51,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/i-guess-i-just-want-strangers-to-tell-me-its-going-to-be-fine-ive-been-in-severe-depression-for-1-yr-current-long-term-project-made,1,9,483

Having been clinically depressed and close to people with clinical depression, I can tell you that even the idea itself of ""I'm tired of this never ending cycle"" is part of the depression. One day, probably soon, when you are better you will look back at this and not believe that you were feeling this numb and desperate. The truth is that you've not been depressed for most of your life and you won't be depressed for most of your life. But you need to see yourself through this period.
Keep fighting for your health and advocate for yourself, including with your psychiatrist. Drugs work with most people but you need to find the right one that works for you and there are treatments available if you don't respond to drugs well.
Don't give in the desperation, you will see this through and find your life as fulfilling and meaningful as you did before and as others do. You're not alone - realize that many people before you have felt this way, many people are feeling like that right now and many will feel that way in the future.

If not, why not give your B and C work and use that extra time / mental load to push yourself to go for a daily walk, or spend 20 minutes talking to a friend?

Depression,Other,an Enterprise Architect 1,9 months,"I’ll reluctantly tell you my brief story, so you know there is help out there. At 28 diagnosed with seasonal depression. Put on Wellbutrin. It got me out of it for while, sex was amazing on that stuff at first. Lost weight thought it was some amazing drug. But after awhile it didn’t help. I stopped taking it and could barely get out of bed after a few months. I went back on it and got sexual side affects, which is common for men on anti depressants. Struggled through going off and on it for years trying to maintain a normal life. Fast forward to 42. I was visiting South America, a friend saw my pills on the counter. Anti-depressants are taboo there. He said I think I can help you. Come with me this weekend. I agreed to visit a shaman that practiced Amazon medicine. I thought it was complete bullshit. Medicine comes in pills where I’m from. Whatever it sounds interesting. I won’t get into the details but the guy took me to the edge of death, brought me back and I’m 2 years without a pill. I’m not advocating drug use to solve mental health but I will say it changed my life. The experience was extreme, but I believe it changed my brain chemistry, a reset, they said it opens new neural pathways. I don’t know the science behind it but I’ve never made it off medication for any length of time. My other thought looking back is pharma would have left me broken on a daily pill for life, so I’m a bit jaded that I know a cure exists and solving the problem doesn’t seem to be a priority in the U.S. A daily pill is good for shareholders. I suppose my point is there are other treatments out there. Don’t settle for a pill. It’s not a cure. I don’t really share the story very often because everyone thinks it’s bullshit, but I 100% believe they’ve been curing depression for thousands of years.",2,9/20/24 14:51,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/i-guess-i-just-want-strangers-to-tell-me-its-going-to-be-fine-ive-been-in-severe-depression-for-1-yr-current-long-term-project-made,1,9,507

The market is terrible right now but some things are looking the same everywhere and go beyond “the state of the market”.

We’re seeing a lack of professionalism everywhere (ghosting etc). Now my girlfriend is a recruiter and she sees 2 things especially in this case.
1: automation > why reply to people with concrete feedback when you can just send an automated reply, saves time and confrontation. But this is resulting in bad application experiences!
2: the ghosting > milenials and gen Z are the majority of the workforce and HATE confrontations (I’m in these generations as well and this also applies to me). My girlfriend mentioned that some of her co-workers over time have just completed dodged applicants when they follow-up due to them being scared. I’m not a fan of picking up the phone and following up but I do it because it shows willingness and determination, but a lot of people are scared of this especially if their the ones being followed up after not sticking to their word (“we’ll respond in a week” > only to be followed up after you didn’t keep your word as employer).

Depression,Other,a Senior Manager 2,8 months,"It depends on the level of physical dependency. The tremors can last a few months if you have them. It does get better if you can get past the withdrawals.

Hydrate and watch electrolytes. Your body will also want sugar. Hard candy. Now is not the right time to worry about sugar. Get through detox first.

Your body has been through a lot. It takes time. Be patient. Be compassionate with yourself.

Get support. 12 step programs can be extremely helpful - they are free, and lots of humans who know how to live without alcohol.","10

There is an adult way to do it than saying “no, go see a therapist “. You ARE responsible in a big way. Everything can be right, but if relationships are bad then rest won’t matter. On the flip side, even when everything is wrong, having a solid partner can help massively. Even if they see a therapist, a LOT will depend on how you adjust or not

Talk to them as an SO would , provide assurances and suggest seeking help gently, with your support, But it cannot be “I can do this much, rest should be therapist”.

Therapy is a definite response, but couples therapy may be even better.
There are reasons why people say things. It may be a cry for help, or it may very well be a narcissistic approach to a relationship where one throws blame instead of having meaningful communication.
Either way, if you are in this relationship for real, then I'd say you are both responsible to try your hardest to figure out the why and how behind it all.

Depression,Author,a Manager 1,10 months,"OP is correct, one's happiness relies on one's own efforts. However, one piece of the puzzle _is_ in fact the partner in a relationship. Without a good partner it would be impossible to be happy in a relationship no matter how much work the other person did for their own happiness.

Depression,Other,The Walt Disney Company 1,10 months,"Part of being an adult includes recognizing when one needs to seek professional help because needs are way above and beyond what a partner can provide.

For instance, just venting about a work situation to an SO is one thing that can help alleviate stress to a certain degree but having deep seeded anger issues and bouts of depression is quite another matter - and only a professional has the tools to help address these conditions to improve a person’s emotional state for the long term. This is incredibly important to stress to him. Unfortunately, statistically men are less likely to go to therapy than women.

As SOs there is a symbiotic relationship so of course the actions of one person can impact another, including one’s happiness. However, you are not “responsible” for your SO’s happiness. Responsible implies that all your actions need to be focused around improving their emotional state, which is a very narcissistic POV as well as puts you in a parenting role which will destroy your relationship.",1,9/20/24 14:53,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/today-my-so-said-i-was-responsible-for-their-happiness-i-dont-entirely-agree-i-feel-they-have-a-lot-of-anger-and-depression,1,12,612

Depression,Author,Authora Senior Consultant,4 months,"Why does everyone assume people have self esteem issues?

First I'm not dating both guys simultaneously. Second I didn't know these things about these guys when I 1st met them. With the 1st guy I didn't learn these things about him until months into the relationship. He did treat me pretty well during most of the relationship. I feel really loved, desired and cared for.

As for the 2nd guy I've been seeing him for a couple of months and I just heard about the cocaine last week. So now I'm weighing it and comparing this to the previous guy. He's hot, has a good job where he manages a lot of people and entertains clients and treats me well. So this revelation about the cocaine is like a massive record scratch. His life seems so together.

I guess you think someone with healthy self-esteem would've just broken up with this guy on the spot right after he said that without thinking about it? He's not actively using the cocaine at least as far as I know (Said he's last used it in 6 months ago and it sounds like that was the 1st time in a while) but if I see any evidence that he's addicted that's when I'd run.

Depression,Author,a Manager 2,9 months,Not to add to the depression but this really isn’t the place which can provide you a good chance of actual help. Sure maybe there’s a 0.00001% chance someone here can say something that would magically cure you but it’s slim pickings and if anything social media in general can add to the depression. So…here’s my 2 cents 1) if you know you’re depressed because you’ve been evaluated by a professional licensed therapist then continue working with them to get you through this 2) if you yourself came to this discovery or someone who isn’t a therapist came to this discovery about you then seek a licensed therapist and let them know how you came to the conclusion (if others were involved) and why you believe it’s valid.,2,9/20/24 14:54,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/just-found-out-i-may-have-depression-help,1,14,688

Depression,Other,a Senior Engineering Manager 1,a year,"Job searching is a crapshoot at the best of times. In the current tech environment, it's an order of magnitude more of a crapshoot. It's hard. I was in the same boat and every day was a roller coaster of emotions.

However, this is exactly when you cannot give up. Persistence will enable you to win the job you want. Job searching is like advertising. You hope that the right recruiter / hiring manager sees your resume at the right time and has the right job open for you.

I applied to hundreds jobs over several months. Maybe 2% resulted in initial interviews and fewer through the pipeline until the right job found me.

Keep applying! The more doors you knock on the higher the chances of success. Use your network. Review job descriptions for your ideal job and ensure that your resume hits what the job descriptions are looking for. If you land interviews, then note down the questions your are asked and prepare answers to these for your next interview.

In short prepare, prepare, prepare. You have to be your best when the right opportunity finds you. Have faith. It will find you. It's always darkest before the dawn but you will get through this. This is the time when you must keep going and persist to win.

This is all easy to say I know, but giving up / not preparing / not being at your best, are all guaranteed to fail so what other option do you have? Embrace the tough times. They will make you tougher too!",14,9/20/24 14:56,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/i-have-been-desperately-applying-for-jobs-for-the-past-3-months-with-no-luck-getting-hired-i-have-paid-several-hundreds-of,1,17,780

Depression,Other,a Senior Project Manager 1,a year,"You're not alone, in the number of rejections or that feeling of despair. The market seems to be really slow at the moment almost everywhere and the competition for each role is really strong. Employers can pick and choose and here in the UK have even started reducing the rates being offered because they know there will be someone desperate enough to take the job for lower pay, which will ultimately devalue the whole market.

First thing I would do is use LinkedIn resume builder to make sure your CV is ATS compliant, without that then you won't make it past the AI bots that scan for keywords etc. As already mentioned, tweak your CV to include keywords and phrases from each job advert you apply to, the more times you can include them in past roles the better, but be sure to reword or paraphrase, don't just copy paste.

Lastly, don't feel like it's your fault, it's not. It's factors well outside your control that have thrown so many of us around the world into this position. Something will come up. If you want to talk, just reach out and I'll share my contact details. Timezones aren't important. Helping each other through this time is.

Depression,Other,Booz Allen Hamilton 2,4 months,"As someone with experience with serious mental health challenges in the past, and having multiple clearances across agencies, the issue is not if you had a problem. They know that's human. The important part is to show how you handle it, how you're improving, you grew as a person, what you're doing to stay stable and how long you've been stable. Don't give more detail than needed. As deloitte 1 said, only answer the direct question. Ideally, concisely.

Saying something like... I had a rough time and went through depressive episodes. Since then I've seeked help and been following my therapist's guidance to maintain a healthy mental state. Doing so that's allowed me to stay healthy. The experience show how important mental health is alongside physical health.

Remember, a clearance is about having a trustworthy character. Being trustworthy can mean knowing when to be discreet and when to be truth bombing.

Depression,Other,a Creative Director 1,a year,"I hope you get the help and break you need.

Vibes and words aren’t likely to cure depression. But as you seek medical help and beyond, try remembering one thing: your odds of ever having lived this blip of life in the first place are essentially ZERO. It was astronomically unlikely this one sperm met this specific egg, after the same happened to your ancestors for hundreds of thousands of years, after billions of years of cosmic coincidence led to a habitable Earth in the first place. You are one of the universe’s greatest, luckiest lottery winners, living a cosmic miracle. Sure, many days it will feel like robbery to be spending your cosmic miracle making ads. But nothing can take away the objective preciousness of every breath you take in this one short life you get. To cut it short is akin to tearing up a winning lottery ticket whose odds were 1 in 400 trillion (a real attempt at a calculation that’s been done). Yes, the cosmic miracle can come with lots of suffering… but it’s so worth the fight to try and find happiness.

Depression,Other,a Front-end Developer 1,a year,"Took me a really long time and a mountain of applications to land my first dev job as well. Definitely can relate to the feelings of hopelessness. As far as advice (based on what I’ve seen work with me and others I’ve helped break into the field), I generally point to 2 things.

First, 40 applications per week MINIMUM. Total number of applications means nothing. In the end, this is a numbers game and 40 per week is the magic number that makes the difference between having a chance at scoring an interview vs never hearing back from anybody. Obviously make sure you’re applying to jobs you have some likelihood of getting. It will take time to track down 40+ per week. It’s worth it.

Second, remember that people don’t hire the best developer, they hire who they want to work with. Sure, this means being able to code well for your level. You should be spending hours practicing interview questions each day. However, it also means coming across as a person who is fun to work with. Don’t pretend to be someone you’re not, but I’ve interviewed candidates before and I would always recommend a person who was genuine, courteous, and likable even if they had to work through the questions a little bit rather than someone who was able to instantly answer everything, but was awkward, overly quiet, or hard to get a read on. Find a way to be the most appealing version of yourself in interviews - it will likely involve some major practice as well.

If you’re doing both of those things, then it’s only a matter of time. Might be more time than you’d like, but it will happen. Just keep going. If you need to get a some sort of part-time job to support yourself in the meantime then go for it, but just don’t give up and you’ll be giving this advice to someone else someday like I am. :)",4,9/20/24 19:56,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/ive-been-struggling-to-land-a-job-as-an-entry-level-developer-and-its-causing-me-a-lot-of-depression-i-havent-had-luck-for-the,1,21,888

Depression,Author,a Software Developer 2,a year,"My biggest recommendation would be to create your own experience and keep applying. At the end of the day companies don't really gain much from hiring entry level employees. So you could do what I did and start creating your own experience. Start working on your own project. Make a random website, talk to friends about problems they face and see if you can develop a solution. Go look for unpaid internships too, its a great place to gain experience. But you need to build on your resume and build a portfolio. Also don't be scared to try build connections, talk to people in the industry, go to events and conferences. It seems that you've tried just applying everywhere and hoping for the best. It really isn't that easy unfortunately but if you have the skill and can prove that you are capable by creating your own experience, you'll be surprised on how much it helps with getting a job.",13,9/20/24 19:56,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/ive-been-struggling-to-land-a-job-as-an-entry-level-developer-and-its-causing-me-a-lot-of-depression-i-havent-had-luck-for-the,1,21,901

Also when you apply for position always reach out to your network to see if they have any contacts at the company that can help get eyes on your resume.

Depression,Other,an Analyst Programmer II 1,a year,"I recommend using recruiters to get an initial job with a contract to get your foot in the door. Experience, whether a contract or a permanent position, counts as professional experience. There are apprenticeships as well. IBM is one company that posts those around the beginning of each year.
I have had a recruiter from one IT Staffing agency tell me to use multiple recruiting firms once before. I was out of work for eight months after my initial 6-month contract as a junior full-stack developer; I landed a role as a mid-level developer that a company 5 minutes from my house encouraged me to apply for on LinkedIn about five months after applying. I had figured they passed on me. I was ready to give up the search, but I kept searching.

One thing I can recommend and am a big supporter of is being of a growth-minded mindset; I see the importance of continued improvement and lifelong learning. I continue to learn new skills and technologies while getting more hands-on experience by building projects that can help when applying. I believe others have left.

They aren’t for everyone, but they totally transformed my life. If you’re able to visit him at the inpatient facility, do. Make that time. It feels amazing to have visitors while you’re there. Remind him to take part in all the activities they offer even if he thinks they’re silly. I felt like a child during most of them but somehow I think they did help me. His degree can wait. He can finish when he’s ready. I should’ve taken a pause during college but didn’t and I barely graduated because my grades suffered and that made getting my first job I consulting really difficult. Better to pause and even finish when up to it. I encourage journaling and physical activity (although they make that hard at in patient facilities since you usually can’t go outside). If they allow normal clothing at his facility, that can make a vast improvement. It’s no fun being in there, but it does help. It’ll be rough on you and your partner to see him in there but trust me, it helps.

Find a psychiatrist and therapist. It will take time to find one that is a good fit; same with medication.

I think those were stopped when he arrived back home last week. His doctors out in LA were not as helpful as the ones he used to see in our hometown.

We'll do everything we can for him, obviously. He's also transgender so on top of the mental health things being accepted is another challenge he's faced. Testosterone treatments have helped with appearing male as well as top surgery before he went into college.

His whole life had revolved around success. Maintained a 4.3 GPA In high school in the Cambridge program. 4.1 at USC. Slippage started when he got back from summer break and it was devastating. He attends school of cinematic arts and was fired from a set...unable to concentrate even on simplest of things. Suicidal thoughts constantly now.

Depression,Other,a Manager 1,a year,"Agree with M2 about out patient support. Sadly it’s hard to get into outpatient programs, but it wouldn’t hurt to start looking for a PHP or IOP program now. It took 3 months for me to hear back from an IOP with an opening and by then I was back at work. Definitely having a therapist and psychiatrist lined up will help. I was seeing my therapist 3 times a week when I first got home. Also potentially changing meds may help. I had been on one for years no problem but it no longer worked. Changing made a huge difference. I also went from 4.0+ to barely passing and that is super painful for someone who has always achieved highly. I feel that pain. Is it possible for him to continue seeing his hometown therapists? Telehealth? Mine was able to do that thankfully since I was striking out with other therapists. Just know your alls support is huge. It’s a super scary time for him and for you guys and a strong support system is the foundation for pulling through the dark times.","3

Depression,Other,an Internal Application Developer 1,5 months,"How long have you been doing therapy? I feel like for a lot of people therapy can do nothing for many months and then all of a sudden you have a light bulb session and everything comes together. Other times it’s a slow grind to finding a lifestyle that fits you.

My best friend in college was severely depressed. He was on meds and actively going to therapy. During his finals week, he attempted to take his own life and thank god failed. Over the course of a year, he took a gap year and worked as a custodian. Spending a lot of time thinking about his career and what he wanted. He ended up pursuing animation, going back to school, and he now works full time for a studio 5 years later. He is the happiest I’ve ever seen him. I think finding something you’re passionate about really matters. It is a little cringey for a doctor to say “just need hobbies”, but I think the intention behind that is good and true. Finding a hobby you really like though won’t cure your depression, but it’ll help you manage it. I think my friend being happy now boils down to the culmination of all his hard work to have healthier habits and work on himself consistently (quitting alcohol, finding a purpose in animation, exercising, eating healthier, having a good sleep schedule, etc.). I think he’s essentially become a workaholic, which has plenty of cons, but I think it’s the happiest I’ve ever seen him. Granted none of this may work for you, but I hope you get some value out of his story and experience.

Depression,Other,Dentsu 1,5 months,"To the folks sharing anecdotes re: knowing ppl who have, or attempted, death by suicide: pls be more careful when tossing out your personal assertions re: suicide, especially linkages of ""I know a person who started meds, they took their own life soon after"". While it's true that science shows some potential for the risk of suicidal ideation - for specific meds, and in very specific patient populations (e.g., adolescent males), psychiatrists are trained professionals who study and constantly track the literature. The science is still very unclear as to what causes some ppl to not only have suicidal ideation, but to take that step to act upon. Working with a professional therapist and a licensed, degreed psychiatrist is still the best way, outcomes wise, to help those with chronic mental health issues. So sharing anecdotes that translate into ""don't do X"" is harmful, not helpful, especially if someone is in crisis. I've walked this journey since 2000 personally when I first got my diagnosis, walked it again with my son, starting when he was in high school. It's complicated stuff, best left to the experts. So please refrain from internet diagnosis if possible. I've experienced both active and passive suicidal ideation, especially in the past five years. Two things helped me finally achieve a breakthrough: working with a quality therapist and psychiatrist - again, even though I was already on maintenance meds - and realizing I was an alcoholic who was self medicating, and how harmful that was. I chose to get sober through AA. There just are certain mental health issues you can't simply ""exercise"" or ""hobby"" away. For some of us, more intervention is reqd. so we can even get to the point of exercising or having a hobby.

It’s going to take time but life will get better. I’m sure not having a job is stressful, but I think a move to a country where you speak the language will also help.

It also sounds like this stress may be caused by being in an area where you don’t speak the main language, going home may fix that and may open you up to other job opportunities.

Find a role that looks interesting, has decent benefits, and can get you started back up- maybe it’s a smaller company or a different field than what you’d expect, but stay open.

Depression,Other,a Partner 1,5 months,"It's a steep adjustment and one of the hardest things about the year. People manage it different ways - i can speak to what i did but that doesn't mean it's right for you etc.

(1) laptop everywhere (except Saturday night/ late on Friday). This is always a polarizing one but my feeling was always that it was absurd to not do a fun night because i might need to do something for 15 minutes, i really resolved to never have to leave something ""because i need my laptop really quick.""

(2) really strong preference for late plans. 8pm dinner you can basically always defend on a friday night absent a major crisis and can often defend on a weeknight. On a weeknight hard to full ghost but ""got it, will do shortly"" at 9pm often buys you an hour or two anyway depending on context. I found if i wasn't busy, weeknight plans that started late plus work catchup after could often be defended.

(3) Saturdays i found were mostly safe absent five alarm disasters. Stuff comes up but its rarely ""this hour"", you can will do it and pick it up later in the day. Like an all day hiking trip can be hard but most discrete plans aren't. Ditto sunday before like 5pm. Sunday night sadly is a work night.

(4) understanding friends really help. Most of my friends are in similar jobs so theres a broad based expectation of plans being subject to last minute changes. It's a spectrum of course but the worst off sounding folks are the ones with friends in 9-5s who schedule elaborate involving events regularly (today we go apple picking or whatever). Hard to square that.

(5) you start learning how to work the tempo of your deals to protect times. Ok you need x protected? What can you push forward so its not coming at you then? Often levers you can work as you better understand deal flow.

(6) to be super candid it's just very helpful if you dont sleep a ton since the ability to catch up at night solves a lot of problems and gets things in ""same day"" which if youre out until 11 (or 1) is an issue for some

(7) you also just need a zen about email. Its nine, you're out, you get a surprise ask, ""yep on it in an hour or two!"", back to what you were doing. Dont let it hang over you etc.",18,9/20/24 20:00,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/1st-year-how-to-get-used-to-unpredictability-of-biglaw-im-constantly-canceling-plans-at-the-last-minute-i-know-not-to-make,1,29,1105

Depression,Other,a Partner 1,5 months,"I'll also say, one thing that seems generational as a supervisor is it feels like people see a real binary between ""i will be out of pocket please accommodate"" and ""i cant do anything."" That's a total trap, i cant give you a full social life of protected time fully protected off but you 100% should take a full social life and do the juggling to keep the impact on work manageable (especially with hybrid work where you have so much flexibility to be doing things without my knowing). You should be taking risks and getting away with stuff (and occasionally getting burned and working late or stepping out of your thing as a result)! I took multiple on the low down vacations, was out regularly on weeknights, and that was pre hybrid! It is the way.","4

Depression,Other,Authora Project Coordinator,2 months,"Poster, I recently came to the US and I've learned a few things in my journey.
* Job Exp: write your resume to show Achievements NOT responsibilities.
Example Did x and y and finished project Z xxWeeks faster.
Applied x and y technique that lessened spend by z%

* Mask as much as possible all references to show your experience was international.
Example, All locations are scrubbed on my resume.

* if your intensively job title is different from the job you seek but close, use the USA designations for the prior roles.
Example, oil field drilling engineer becomes project engineer (field)

* Education: if you can afford it, write the PMP and pass it.
Americans prefer you have survived their educational system.

* Be ready to move to move of the 50 states.

* Finally, It's a game of numbers.
Apply to 500 Project Manager roles, be picked for 20 recruiter screening calls, interview with 6, get 2 offers but you only need 1 offer for a start.",21,9/20/24 20:01,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/i-cant-take-it-anymore-im-in-the-middle-of-depressioni-left-my-country-because-i-was-suffering-domestic-violence-and-i-came,1,30,1129

Depression,Other,a Senior Consultant 1,9 months,"Looks like you could be an introvert (like me) which btw is totally okay trust me. I’ve realized that most people go through the same things and some are just better at hiding it. Who knows perhaps that coworker also has nervous breakdown or could even have a crush on you. I can certainly tell you from a male’s perspective that it happens a lot to me. You never know. Couple other tips to befriend people these days and age:

- volunteering
- organizing board game nights with your work colleague (email your team after a project. Even if they’re not single they can come with their SO who could befriend you and/or introduce you to that colleague’s brother or sister… limitless possibilities)
- sports league (find one that you like and you’ll be in teams with folks that you can later catch drinks or dinner with)

The goal is to get yourself out there. It’s hard I know but I really believe that you can pull it off.

PS: if you like tennis and want to play with a novice in Grant park, hmu. I do have to disclose that I have a gf so you two could practice and befriend each other while I play with the boys.","1

From what I can tell with your reply you’re a 10/10 personality wise and I’m sure many would agree. We would all also agree that you’re definitely not too old. I know age is more of a complex for women but I’m 💯 sure that there’s nothing wrong with you. You have good EQ and have the courage, drive and right attitude. You got this!!","1

Depression,Other,a Senior Consultant 1,9 months,"I disagree with that one OP. Black women are beautiful and wanted, white women are beautiful and wanted, asian women are beautiful and wanted and so are latino women who are also beautiful and wanted. You got the point… and the same goes with body types. Put aside all we see on social media, news or whatever people do these days to get attention. I strongly believe that attraction is something that’s both physical and emotional. To one guy, you could be a 10 physically and 1 inside, to another it could be the opposite and or even a 10 overall. The truth is that everyone has their own scale and sometimes need to fail a relationship or two before they realize what they truly wants. The most important thing is that you focus on yourself and learn to believe that you’re that 10 out of 10 physically and emotionally for yourself. When a woman believes it, there’s a glow of confidence that most men find attractive. Those that are also battling with insecurity may be intimidated by it but a confident human being, regardless of the gender, is always attractive. Note that confidence can be interpreted in different ways so to be clear, confidence means here someone who knows who they are and doesn’t seek validation (physical or personality wise)","2

Depression,Other,a Counsel 1,3 months,"I originally resisted meds. Told my doctor I was going to try St. John’s Wort instead. Didn’t think that was doing anything for me, so when I ran out, didn’t bother getting more. A few days later I found myself spiraling again, then it hit me - meds actually DO help, for me. I don’t have doubts about my ability or childhood issues to process or anything; I just get overwhelmed by everything that’s happening to me and the demand on me, and I practice avoidance and procrastination, to an extreme. Will do anything BUT work - obsessively. My thoughts jump like a squirrel on a hamster wheel, randomly, and I freeze up. And I do exercise regularly, eat well, see friends, meditate, etc., it’s just not enough, by itself, to manage the stress resulting from my symptoms.

I’m honestly not sure whether it’s depression or undiagnosed ADD, and I don’t care. I just need to be functional, and the meds do that for me. I’ve also done a round of neurofeedback treatment, which has helped. Pro tip: many SSRIs make me clench my jaw until it aches. A nurse practitioner friend who’s ADHD recommended tizanidine (a muscle relaxer), which helped considerably.

I just need to be functional.","1

During this time, I can answer nature’s call and STRETCH before 6am when I walk, run, lift weights, calisthenics, or yoga. Whatever it is, it starts with walking outside.

Depression,Author,Authoran Associate,8 months,"Exactly! I could have phrased the post better, but you get the point.

Answering your question: no, men do not cry to each other frequently. I don’t think I’ve ever cried in front of another man. So maybe I’ve answered my on own question haha

The only person I’ve ever cried in front of was my ex-girlfriend and my parents","1

Depression,Other,Authora Project Management,3 months,"You’re describing one of the four modes of behavior that had been identified in the 1978 article on Impostor Phenomenon: women intentionally using charm to get something, like get praise from their superiors about their intellect. And then not trusting the praise, even if it’s authentic, thinking that the praise had been given because of their feminine attributes (and then they experienced impostor feelings.) This mode of behavior is never talked about these days when talking about Impostor Syndrome… but is this what’s causing your anxiety/depression?

To everyone who’s giving advice to “use it while you still have the looks”, please stop. It only adds to the (anxiety) issue.

Depression,Author,Authora Project Management,3 months,"Thanks for the insight, that’s interesting and I see what you mean. My anxiety/depression comes more so from issues from my childhood and excess worry of issues I can’t help.
I also recognize I’m a high performer at work, plus I am a pretty good public speaker.
I’m ok with aging, believe me! At 30 I fully recognize what a gift it is to grow older each year. I have never used fillers, Botox, gone under the knife or anything. I welcome the grey hair when it comes in. Same with each smile line. ❤️","1

Depression,Other,,3 months,"I’m happy to hear you haven’t done any of those “beauty” enhancing things. I haven’t either. I’m 48, but according to many look decades younger. Maybe _because_ I haven’t done any of these and would refuse when beauticians would offer when I was about 30.

As for depression/anxiety, I’m sorry to hear you are struggling with those issues… you may already know that psychologists long ago proved that reliving a past issue isn’t going to resolve it. Ie typical (Freudian) psychotherapy to go over childhood trauma or sit in another negative issue isn’t helpful. There’s another method, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, that helps with replacing negative thoughts with positive. It basically rewires your brain. If you haven’t tried it, check it out!

Good luck ❤️","1

And funny enough, I no longer take “you look younger than your age!” as a major compliment.

You could try a situation like that. To keep yourself interested and invested in conversation, you could be the one to start, about a topic you like- just make sure to engage the other person, perhaps by asking their opinion on it. Smalltalk also works, you can try eventually relating other topics into that conversation to shift the focus without dropping the chat off. You can even try this on customers first, before trying it on coworkers- if things don't go well at first, any one customer is just an occasional visitor, while a coworker will routinely be back.

Depression,Other,The Walt Disney Company 1,10 months,"Hey there!

I have the same mental “issues” you have but way older than you. I didn’t even know about these issues until last year.

I have been a top performer due to my diligence, conscientiousness, and openness. Sometimes I do tend to overextend myself to exhaustion (forcing myself to be in social situations even though I really just want to go home and watch Netflix or play video games)

The best advice I could give is fake it til you make it, but know your limits, which you already do.

Growth comes from getting out of your comfort zone.

When you said “it’s very hard to convince myself to” - you have this internal argument with yourself. You said you WANT to, yet you are still in the process of “convincing” yourself. That to me is like “well even if I don’t want to I really don’t have to”

You know how muscular people get fit? It’s because they lifted weights probably 2-3x a week. They’ve put in the work. They didn’t have those muscles before, but now they do.

You know how people become great at what they do, whether it’s art, science, or math? Because they’ve dedicated some time and focus to hone their skills or solve problems.

Is it always enjoyable? Maybe for a few.. and by a few, perhaps less than 5% of them… but the lesson here is that being “social” is a skill that you can learn.

If you want a shortcut though, you can use “nootropics” or “mushroom coffee” or some of the racetams… or psychedelics lol.

Truth of the matter is we are all wired a certain way that makes it harder for us to do some things that are easy for others. You probably have skills that are hard to do for others as well. It’s just about exploring those avenues that you haven’t explored yet - whether or not having your brain rewired by a drug, by an event, or anything that you haven’t done before.

The important thing is to remind yourself that just because you have ADHD and autism, it limits you from what you can do. You certainly can. You just need to tell yourself you’re going to do what you “want” to do and you’ll actually do it. It’s okay to fail, just don’t quit and keep trying.",3,9/20/24 20:06,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/im-a-19-year-old-with-high-anxiety-and-depression-as-well-as-a-mentally-disabled-individual-namely-adhd-and-autism-im-generally,1,38,1440

Depression,Other,KPMG 1,10 months,"Yet you do. Everyone and their mom is self-diagnosing, which does not take away from the <5% of us which have been diagnosed for a long time by a psychiatrist because our childhood experiences were fundamentally different and more challenging than our peers. Shit just doesn't click the same in this funky old brain of mine. That can be a superpower but also brings a lot of isolation.

Knowing that my mirror neurons are less active, and that my brain is not functioning the same, helps me to understand why I face these challenges. That is then the starting point to work on them, not to accept it and ask others to facilitate my mental disabilities à la TikTok in 2023.

I have moved on the spectrum through learned behaviors, and my symptoms are far less debilitating after 10+ years of intense cognitive behavioral therapy. Had I not been diagnosed and received that guidance, I would not even have finished high school.

Don't just disregard people who say they are autistic with those comments. It's a bit of a trigger for sure, hence this rant, but it fits in our usual experience - functioning in society does not come to neurodiverse people the same way as it does to you, nor do you understand that, let alone the biological reason as to why we are so different.","5

It is a scientific fact that brains with ADHD and autism are different.

Those of us who know our diagnoses are better set up to create a life that works best for our needs and skills. OP, knowing yourself is the first step!

Depression,Other,Google 1,7 months,"And yet, people strive to go there, yes? It’s not like OP went in not expecting any of this. Why go there at the expense of mental and physical sanity if it is THIS level of toxicity that this person is trying to kill themselves? I’m genuinely just curious! Exactly what is so good about MBB that it is worth more than someone’s mental sanity?

I also believe that OP is an immigrant to the country they’re in (likely USA), so while I understand that choices are limited when you’re on a work VISA, I still think there was no way McKinsey was OP’s only choice, knowing how hard it is to go into MBB firms.

So again, I respectfully and humbly challenge this post and also your comment which essentially says, ‘oh well, it’s a company that hires slaves and there’s nothing HR can do’.

Then I gotta say there’s not much anybody can really do here, other than what I and others already did, which is express true sympathy, despite the situation seeming to be not completely unavoidable? Step on hot coal and then complain that feet are burning? OP is clearly unable to deal with this and they’re asking a question how to.

Again, I am not trying to be pedantic but just genuinely trying to understand how something like a job and a brand can be so appealing that even thinking of ending your own life daily is considered a plausible byproduct? I would be grateful if you could shed some more light on this.","1

A lot of high achievers that MBB hire have this bias, and they don’t like to admit they are struggling, so they keep trying miserably. And when the ship is sinking it’s like your whole self worth is sinking with it, but you are too scared to quit or admit you lost the battle.

It’s ridiculous when I’m thinking about it now but I had identify crisis when I left bcg, I didn’t know who I was what I could do, I attached my everything to this role and painfully struggled, it became my source of self validation. It was months of therapy that took me out of it","2

Depression,Other,a Driver 1,8 months,"My ex faced this. He got his own home, let his elderly mother and father stay in their home with home health aide workers - one for AM shift and one for PM shift until his Dad who sadly had his cancer go out of remission might have actually been able to go into Assisted Living but sadly died while my hubby and I were divorcing. The elderly mom continued with partial live-in aides until she passed in her 90’s but they had a housekeeper who kept her home clean and the aides helped with his mother’s bathing and dressing and drove her places her son could not always take her. Then they cooked meals for her and day aide would stay with her till night and go home then the night worker aide would show up to stay overnight until the next morning. It was cheaper than nursing home care or assisted living. My own 99 year old widowed mom lived 35 years in a two story lake front home my deceased dad who died in 2000 at age 77 built and custom designed for her. She stayed in it and had planned to until she was diagnosed at age 96 with dementia. But 35 years later with a completely paid off custom home built themselves for less than $200,000 as general contractors on land they bought 10 years prior to my HS graduation in May 1980, she sold it for $575,000 but easily she could have got a $1,000,000 price tag for her custom two story lakefront home with a boat dock and stairs leading to a nice large covered boat house with a big garage for a boat and jet ski. She took the half million dollar payday, invested it in her long held Vanguard Fund and now lives in a 2 bedroom Seattle suburb apt with my older widowed 74 year old sister comfortable until she has to go into their memory care unit. She was diagnosed with beginning dementia at age 96. She’s now age 99.

Depression,Other,"a VP, Government Relations 1",8 months,"To qualify for VAD in Switzerland, you have to be able to prove you have the cognitive capability to make the decision at the time that you are choosing to die. It’s a pretty thorough review process involving sending your medical records and interviewing with doctors there three times. Spain, however, just passed a law that allows somebody in earlier years to indicate a desire for such an end-of-life decision even in the event that they become incapacitated by dementia so the family can honor their wishes. Depending on the level of cognitive decline (having lost several family members to Alzheimer’s), I don’t believe that someone in advanced stages can be considered a reliable steward for their own care decisions.

With different dementias already the fastest growing chronic disease in the world and an issue that is expected to double in the next twenty years, building a system where people can die with dignity and not be forced into a protracted, highly unpleasant last decade of life is something that really needs to happen.",,9/20/24 20:08,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/my-fil-is-in-poor-health-paraplegic-respiratory-cardiac-issues-dementia-and-depression-we-have-begun-to-look-at-assisted,5,43,1573
Depression,Other,a Vice President 1,8 months,"Agreed. As of right now there is no path. My parent, given an accurate assessment of their condition down the line, may well have been one to prepare a directive. But as the case is, they are happy as a clam in their new simpler world. That will change, I’m sure, but rn they’d happily tell you they are doing just great and feeling fine. There’s not always an awareness of what’s lost and I think trying to time your exit with cognitive issues would be nearly impossible. When you are well enough to say “now” you have no idea how long you have left that’s good. And your definition of what’s “good” changes along with your brain. The line is really blurry. And would a family m’amener really be able to submit a person for that directive when that person is right there saying no?!?
Cognitive decline is the new cancer. They have to find ways to mitigate it or we are in for a world of misery and a collapse of the elder care system as we know it.","1

Depression,Other,a Transcriptionist 1,8 months,"VP-GR1 - I'm very grateful to live in Canada. We already have MAiD (Medical Assistance in Dying) and this year they are expanding the acceptance criteria. Right now the patient has to be at the terminal stage of an illness which is irremediable, and all avenues of treatment have been proven to be failures. The new regulations will expand to include patients who are terminal but not yet actively dying. These will include patients with Lou Gehrig's disease (ALS), Parkinson's Disease, and other diseases that are eventually terminal but which cause brutal pain and almost zero quality of life for the sufferers. Instead of having to wait until their bodies deteriorate so much that they require hospice care, these patients will now be eligible to apply for MAiD when quality of life becomes non-existent for them.","1

Depression,Other,"a VP, Government Relations 1",8 months,"T1, that’s great to hear.

It’s the only way they were able to get the laws passed, but it excludes so many people who would otherwise - with thoughtful intention - choose a dignified death outside of those parameters.

To your point, there are many diagnoses that are truly horrendous that people would absolutely choose to avoid the worst of, whether that’s the last year or two of their life, and as it’s allowed now, those people have to get to the absolute worst of things before they can choose their own life’s ending (if they are lucky enough to live in one of those states). And people diagnosed with dementia deserve that option, as well, given the lack of treatment available, so they can avoid life without any knowledge of who they are, a total lack of their true personality, and potentially causing great distress and expense for their family members (a real consideration for many older adults).

And people diagnosed with dementia deserve that option, as well, given the lack of treatment available, so they can avoid life without any knowledge of who they are, a total lack of their true personality, and potentially causing great distress and expense for their family members (a real consideration for many older adults).

If you can’t tell, this is something I am incredibly passionate about. 🙂",,9/20/24 20:08,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/my-fil-is-in-poor-health-paraplegic-respiratory-cardiac-issues-dementia-and-depression-we-have-begun-to-look-at-assisted,1,43,1577

Depression,Other,Deloitte 1,8 months,"What state /city are you located in, if you don't mind sharing? Honestly there's a lot of factors that can affect this process, but the big 4 (no pun intended) are (assuming this is a United States of America post).

1. Conditions/ Care Needs - individually and in combination can open or narrow your field. Someone who ""just' needs ""Memory Care"" is a different story than cognitive+physical deficits, plus other factors

2. Locality - Your/his location *heavily* affects your options. Rural / Underserved area vs. A ""Blue Zone"", proximity and number of hospitals, etc

3. Funding and insurance coverage.

4. The level of quality and care that you are willing to accept (this is a cold, awful way to put this, but it *is* a huge factor, please don't read this as anything other than that).

Depression,Other,a Sales Executive 1,8 months,"If your FIL was in the military during Korea or Vietnam there is something called Veterans Aid and Attendance. It will go towards assisted living care. They can only have a max of $150,000 of assets not including the house. .
Unfortunately assisted living and memory is expensive. Long term Care is the ONLY insurance that helps pay for assisted living. No —-Medicare does not cover it. Depending on where you living AL averages around 4500 a month. It includes all meals, transportation , 24 hr care, help dressing, bathing, and other activities of daily living. Memory care is around $5,500/ month. MC is all inclusive also and there are activities in both.
Care aides in your home start at $30/ hr. ( that’s not a registered nurse) If they don’t show up someone in the family has to cover that shift.
There is no way around it. Assisted Living and memory care living is out of pocket or private pay. Once your in-laws have exhausted all but $2,000 of assets they will qualify for Medicaid. People treat their dogs better that the staff treats their patients that are covered by Medicaid. Those nursing homes are also rehab facilities.
Sorry for the bleak info. What’s important is the quality of the remainder of their life. Hopefully they saved some money or have assets. There are good communities out there that take great care of people. You have to do your homework. Check out the length of their licensing. Go online to the Department of Social services and look up the communities to see their violations. Be involved. I have been in the assisted living field for 2 years and your story is not uncommon. It is however heart breaking and Unfortunately our health care system is broken.

A few things we have noticed: extra foreplay is helpful, doing something to help him relax is helpful (like a little bit of a back massage), we have better luck in the morning vs. late in the evening.

At first I was looking to stay in my industry since I have been successful at it for long and have so much experience. I also wanted to be compensated accordingly but I am burning thru my life savings fast. Seems like the industry is no longer a collaborative, positive environment but full of toxicity. They are only interested in hiring recent grads or interns which leads me to believe they are not financially stable. Started applying for bridge jobs I would have never considered in the past and still no job offer. There are plenty of scams.

You're looking for your wins with the potential employers who take recruiting seriously. Don't focus so much on the rejections.

Depression,Other,an Associate 4,9 months,"I informed the firm (HR and my supervisor) only that I had a “medical condition” that required my taking leave.

I was evaluated by my primary care physician and a psychiatrist and they both recommended I take leave immediately.

I started the leave as soon as I could, notifying HR by email. A few days later, I submitted FMLA paperwork signed by my primary care provider.

The exact sequence of steps may differ for you and others here but the main principles are to 1) only identify that it’s a medical condition; 2) work with HR to confirm what procedure you need to follow; and 3) have a medical doctor fill out any forms. Having your primary care provider do it will also keep the exact reason confidential.

During leave, work with your psychiatrist and therapist to develop a treatment plan. The treatment plan and recovery timeline will differ for everyone, based on your diagnoses. It can take a long time to recover from mental health issues and the process is not linear, but there is hope.","4

Depression,Author,Authoran Attorney,4 months,"P1. There are many dumb assumptions in your reply. I didn't go back to the office in 2020 and early 2021 because the office was closed. Once we could go back in late 2021, the firm had moved offices and was asking everyone to agree to and be assigned new offices. The partners in my group refused to agree on where their new offices were and (without asking) signed us all up to be fully remote or hotel office users only. The main partner in my group who was against return to office moved to Florida during the pandemic and told us all we needed to be united in refusing to return. He eventually left the firm last year and now things are starting to normalize and we all have regular offices again.","1

Depression,Other,a Licensed Realtor 1,9 months,"I'm sorry you going through this. Isn't it possible to get unemployment when it's a toxic work place and reason to leave, I'm sure if you explain to them the postpartum depression, he told you that it wasn't real and that you were over reacting, the fact that he didn't want to do the paperwork that came with firing you so he cut back all your time to two shifts so you would quit and you have kids and mouths to feed they would give you unemployment.

Depression,Other,a Licensed Realtor 1,9 months,"I've been there. Your options are to first check your employee handbook. In some cases providing any information about you, positive or negative, is against company policy. So you could contact HR or the upper manager, owner, etc, and let them know this manager is violating company policy. All you have to do is have a friend call and pretend to be a potential employer to find out if this is happening. If he is slandering you with untruths, your next option is to call and let him know you have evidence he is defaming you and he needs to cease immediately or you will take him to court for defamation of character. If you have a lawyer friend, you can also ask them to send a ""scary letter."" These defamation cases can favorably win around $25k in damages if you have solid proof that what was said was untrue and caused you harm. If you want to actually go the legal action route, you should first hire a reference-checking company and see what he is saying about you. What they report back to you is credible evidence.","1

When you see your friend after a long time, all you want to do is share joy and excitement of seeing this person again.

About the antidepressants- I researched the side effects of it and extremely scared of cognitive consequences. All I have is my ability to stay focused and stay creative at work, if i loose it - then I lose the ability to work and earn money for living at all. So this is like loop.

1. An amazing support system. Could not do it without my wife's support
2. Standard anti-depressant that I know works for me
3. Sleep - I get 8 hours most nights, which I know is not the norm. But I've managed to make it work
4. Cardio - I give on this sometimes, but I find it is so huge for my anxiety
5. Eat healthy and intermittent fast - keeps my energy levels high
6. A mortgage at 6% interest and bills to pay (admittedly makes anxiety worse, but keeps me working hard 😂)
7. Propranolol for public speaking - seriously. This changed my life haha

If you are thriving in a job that demands a fair amount of medication in order to perform, I would question if the job is really worth it.

Though I've since left and taken on less stressful roles, the one thing I realized about MBB is that no amount of therapy or medicine could reduce the relentless grind/pressures of MBB -- because they're not truly tackling the root cause of it (the negative feedback culture, cutthroat performance reviews, imbalanced hierarchy dynamics, normalized problematic working norms, artificial sense of urgency).","3

Depression,Other,a Creative 1,a year,"I have depression and anxiety too btw, on med. I hope you're getting therapy.

Staying in your head like that when job hunting is difficult.

Treat job hunting like a job. Take breaks. You can't will it into existence. Staring at LinkedIn all day and looking at job listings do your head in.

Build up a routine as if you're working a real job. Exercise. Get out. Socialize. Give yourself working hours to job hunt and do what you need like find referrals or make connections. Try looking for other creatives in the same shoes to partner up and do something.

Never put everything in one basket or pine for that dream job. You're setting yourself up for a world of pain (like you are now). I used to have panic attacks after interviews and cry.

You've only just started the marathon. I've been let go a couple of times, as have many on here.

This isn't a thin-skinned or a weak will game. When you do land a real job, you'll need stronger mental fortitude and resilience to bounce back.

If you don't learn to look after yourself, this is a rollercoaster that'll grind you up and spit you out.","5

I don’t know if it lifts some of the pressure you’re putting on yourself but absolutely no one is “handed” connections in ad school.

And widen is the best of the best. They don’t respond to anyone.

You’re at the beginning of your career so I think this will be most helpful. You can’t spend all of your time and energy focusing on what others have. Life will never be fair. The sooner you learn to use what you’ve actually got to your advantage, the better. Even it’s a tiny shop, do what it takes to get some work/any work made and work your way up and get rid of the ego.

Try to stretch every day, walk 3-5 times a week, and maybe try something like an under the desk pedal bike for the off days when working (you can find one under $50 bucks on Amazon or check Facebook marketplace).

Exercise is a good way to improve mood, but the real issue is your relationship with food (girl, I feel this to my core). If you really want to lose weight, you will need to come to terms with the food side of the equation (I’ve gained a lost 70 lbs twice now). Emotional eating (I celebrate with food and I console with food, that’s not healthy) and this is area I really focus on - yours might be different. Weight loss is 90% done in the kitchen!","3

For diet, be realistic about where you’re faltering. Keep a food diary for a week: do you keep snacks in the house? Do you crave sweets or salt? Eat when anxious? Swap them out for healthy alternatives. Keep prepped fruit, veg, and nuts in the house instead of sweets or chips. Drink an herbal tea instead of eating when you know it’s an anxiety craving.

You’re overweight to the point that just being in a 500 daily calorie deficit without even exercising will drop weight off of you easily. If you aren’t actually medically handicapped and have a condition. Walk even if it hurts. Stop taking medications and eat 1600 calories a day and drink 100 oz of water.

Depression,Other,a Legal Assistant 1,9 months,"Do you have the funds to work with a registered dietitian and/or personal trainer? They can give customized advice better than any of us.

That said…

Exercise: swimming, pool running (you wear a belt to float and you move your arms and legs as if you’re running), water fitness classes, at-home core workouts on youtube, chair workouts from youtube, start strength training upper and lower body, try a stationary bike at the gym, or cycling classes. At your current weight, your feet will hurt when walking probably regardless of anything, unfortunately. If you want to lose weight through exercise, it might just be something you have to push through. I like that you’re seeing a PT.

Diet: track how much protein you’re eating each day. If you don’t eat enough protein, you will feel constantly hungry. Eat healthy fats like nuts and avocado, avoid saturated/trans fats. Cook with avocado oil instead of butter or canola oil. Drink LOTS of water. The recommend amount per day that I’ve heard is 1oz for every 2lbs of bodyweight. Have balanced meals with protein, fiber, healthy fat, and complex carbs. Make an effort to become more mentally aware of your eating habits. When you eat something, ask yourself why you chose it, whether it was satiating, how full you feel, etc. I started noticing that simple carbs (though delicious) really don’t do much in terms of satisfying my hunger so I make sure I add some protein and fats.",,9/20/24 20:53,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/i-got-divorced-in-mid-2021-my-partner-cheated-at-the-time-i-was-185-poundsso-overweight-but-fine-then-the-depression-hit-and,1,57,1909

Depression,Other,Howard county general hospital 1,6 months,It’s tough out there these days. I know it’s hard to apply & apply & still not get an offer. Watch videos to help with resume & interview tips. Just not having a steady schedule can open the door to depression.

Depression,Author,a Transcriptionist 1,6 months,"You have some good steady past history - you should be a ""good catch"" for some company. Are you working with a job coach? A recruiter or head hunter? Some jobs never get posted publicly - they are handed directly to a recruiter that the company has had good results with before. The visible ads - newspapers, computer websites, etc.) list the jobs that would appeal to the general public, but they often hold back ads for certain jobs for which they want a very specific type of individual for so they want to avoid getting 500 resumes from people they would not consider. Job recruiters are aware of these unadvertised positions; they also have wide networks that they can consult and find out if anyone has heard of anything through another network. This is a lot of work for you, and it can be very disheartening when there are no replies from your resumes. It doesn't mean your experience is no good - it simply means that your listed skills and past work don't fit exactly into the template that the hiring company is looking for.

Depression,Other,a Creative Director 1,2 months,Did you intern anywhere? If not I would start there. You need to build connections and start networking. Check out local networking events.

Depression,Other,a SR. Visual Product Designer 1,2 months,"No offense, but you are applying for jobs that involve competing against Juniors, Seniors, and Directors for any position with degrees in BFA and MFA. The market has been flooded with Layoffs, such as in my situation from Nike, which is why it is currently tough not just for you but for everyone else. If you want to stand out, you need to upscale your designs—even if you make concepts.

I would say yes to cover letters, as some companies do care. If you know how to write, it can make you stand out, so I would continue submitting them with your resume.

This year alone, I have applied to over 600+ jobs. Yes, there have been lows, but it is definitely worth it when you get that opportunity.

Apply to anything and everything! Internships included, does not matter if you’re out of school “it’s an opportunity”

Just my two cents...

Depression,Other,a Senior Graphic Designer 1,2 months,"This creative market is absolutely full of graphic designers and when the roles dont come, they head into the freelance world. You could throw a project into a field and watch everyone fight over that logo design. BUT!!

Think about the other jobs on offer. Graphic designers are not always great artworkers. Learn the tech side of artworking. If not, designers or graphic designers are not keen to work in powerpoint. But that is what corporate world needs. Good designer that create PP content. Once in then you can offer more! What about elearning design? All these elements need a core level of good design. Its not all about agency work or branding. Everyone gets sucked into the glam and insta world of brand design. Just think wider and once you get in somewhere. That is when you start flexing. Most important, really question wveey piece in your portfolio. Research the company and tap into what they want. Listen to podcast regarding the creative process. Dont just show the end result, most people just show end product. But art directors, want to see your thinking. Anyone can produce a slick mockup.

Depression,Other,a Counsel 1,5 months,"Hmmm, well they told me 6 weeks back when I started taking it, and that proved out about right. Perhaps the online folks are experiencing placebo effect (although I always say that if I’m feeling better, who cares whether it’s because the medicine is actually doing something or I just believe it does?). Or perhaps the meds act differently in different people (highly likely).

If our testing (me and my husband, plus our daughter) actually shows ADHD, we’re going to try neurofeedback and mild electrical stimulation to see if that will help. It’s expensive and (of course) not covered by insurance, but if it works, great.

I have a friend whose son was so depressed he was on suicide watch, had tried several times, and had been that way throughout his teens and young adult life without any meds helping. They explored Ketamine therapy, but were told that the future was in magnetic treatments. They tried that. His case was so severe it took about 4 months to work, but it eventually helped significantly. He’s now only on mild doses of meds and living a productive life.

My neuro doc says that the method essentially disrupts the brain entirely with the hope that it will reorganize itself into more “normal,” useful patterns. About half the time it works, though the South Carolina clinic that pioneered it (in Charleston, I think?) claims about an 80% success rate. For those folks, for whom no other treatment worked, it is an absolute miracle.",,9/20/24 20:56,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/has-anyone-here-been-able-to-successfully-treat-their-depression-with-whatever-means-possible-pharma-ketamine-ayahuasca,7,61,2003

Depression,Author,a Traveling Inventory Associate Driver 1,5 months,"Get you a Therapy Lamp... They are special made lamps for people whose body's chemical makeup is a little different of the normal. For you, I would suggest checking into therapy lamps that help people who fall on the Bipolar Spectrum 🫡 People who fall on that spectrum have trouble with their moods because of their internal clocks are off due to the amount of light u are receiving which has a major influence with people falling on the spectrum. Please do not take this offensive.. but I believe u fall on the spectrum of bipolar.. which is not as bad as a thing as people stereotype it to be, it's just means ur internal clock operates off of sunlight and if ur clock is off then it will affect ur mood. While the average person biological internal clock is automatically adjusted. So imagine that People who fall on the spectrum have a analog clock as an internal clock... And Average Ppl have a digital clock.. Analog clocks need to be manually adjusted during daylight savings time.. while digital clocks automatically do it by it's self.. A therapy light will help u adjust ur internal clock, so the loss of an hour of sunlight doesn't effect ur mood in a sporadically way. Do u find urself to be more energetic during the summer and less motivated during the winter times?? Do u find urself arguing more and clashing heads with other more in the winter.. while I'm the summer ur calm and chilled?? If so, U fall on that spectrum.. I remember reading a book about falling on the Spectrum when I was in Jail.. and I fall on that spectrum as well 🫂 so it's nothing to feel shameful about.. also get u a pair of rose glasses because they help filter out specific rays of light so ur internal clock can be balanced out a bit better... I tried finding that book for u.. couldn't find it.. However, I did find an online article that explains what the book did.. take a look at it.. this will not only help u with ur motivation issue.. it will also give u more insight on what's actually going on with ur body.. because of how differently ur body processes light rays.. usually ppl who fall on the spectrum are missing a certain kind of tubes in their eyes that prevent their body to process a certain ray of light in the sunlight which throws off ur internal clock, effecting ur mood ✌️😎 Ur body just reacts to sun rays differently than what the average person's body.. there's nothing wrong with you where you need to be put on meds and having to report to a therapist because ppl labeled u with a mental disability/disorder.. I know it's ur internal clock that off due to u mentioning setting ur alarm clock but still not being able to get out of bed 🫡 Ur not focusing on the right clock.. ur issue is ur internal clock.. not depression 💯💯💯 I believe u might fall on the sliding scale of Hypomania Bipolar.. I think thats where I fell too.. my apologies for not being able to find the book online. At least I was able to point u in the right direction.. research more about Light and the Effects it has on ppl on the spectrum 💪🥷☯️👑

Depression,Author,U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs 1,5 months,"This was (is still kinda) me. Unfortunately I don’t have any advice. I can tell you what happened to me and hopefully you can find something that speaks to you:

Was in a toxic relationship and was being crushed by my religion. I fell into a depression and became suicidal. I met a person who was a friend of my not-yet-ex and basically over shared and overburdened him, thinking that if someone knew it would help. And it did a little, but it mainly backfired as he became distant due to everything I put him through.

I went through a major identity crisis. I really had to look inside and outside of myself to find what I felt was right for myself. This actively contributed to my depression. I eventually sorted it (for me it was realizing I don’t agree with religion and that’s okay), but the depression didn’t go away. I moved to a new location because I hated where I was living, and it helped but I was still bad. I officially broke things off with my ex, who I now live with as a friend, which helped a little but not entirely.

I have a lot of regrets. Things I wanted to finish and havent yet. I also am pretty aimless in life. No goals, no career paths, no understanding of how the world works. I don’t speak with my parents.

My (now not close) friend’s dad showed me how money works. What a 401k is and got me a financial advisor. Somewhere along the way the depression lifted a little by little. My friend used to ask me “what do I want?” And I never knew. I always thought I never wanted to be alone. And I don’t. But now I know some more just by accepting that what I like isn’t bad. I like to watch the fireworks and play games. I like to walk around new places with friends. And at some point I realized that if I’m just sad and negative all the time people will not want to hang out with me. And that if I want to do something I should find people who do those things.

I live with my ex as a friend because I can’t live by myself. I have no idea what would happen if I was alone. My life isn’t “great”, idk if it’s even good. But I get up and do the things I need now. I made a schedule and I stick to it. I don’t feel suicidal hardly at all anymore. Just rarely. I saw a nutritionist and got my eating on track. Using my work’s focus on health to get me back into a workout routine.

I dont know if this is how life is supposed to feel. I think I broke my happy meter a long time ago. But at the very least I don’t always feel awful. That’s gotta be something, maybe. Mainly just feel very neutral.",2,9/20/24 20:56,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/has-anyone-here-been-able-to-successfully-treat-their-depression-with-whatever-means-possible-pharma-ketamine-ayahuasca,1,61,2012

Experiment (with your doctor's) on medications and psychotherapy treatments.

Journal, reflect, and practice what you learn in therapy.

I went through the typical cycle of being in denial, anger, bargaining, depression and then acceptance. My situation hasn’t improved but I’m dealing with my circumstances much better and I can say most days I’m at peace. I read lot of psychology related books on coping and mental health, listen to various podcasts, workout and take care of myself.

It’s so, so, so good to talk through your feelings and just … get that crap out. And it can help you with how to help your family. I think it’s important to understand the line where your kids help you, and where they drain you. You need to understand and respect that you must balance your kids’ needs with your own.

I know starting the program is probably exciting and scary and making you feel guilty for doing something for you, whatever other feelings you might have and it’s really unfortunate you couldn’t do it as planned.
If you won’t be able to start it asap can you hire a sitter or ask a friend near you to watch your kid when your husband is “unable”?
It might help show your husband “hey you weren’t there when needed and I need to care for myself to be healthy, and keep our family together” so I did what was needed","3

We don’t know OP or her husband. All we have is a short blurb. But again, my experience, based on advice taught to me by a trusted older sister figure, is that the best way is to go to him and say, “hey, you and I need to figure this out together; this is something we both need”.

I would imagine all the companies he listed will be similar to amazon since they provide name recognition and I’m sure those wanting to work their want high salaries and willing to deal with the stress to get it.

It would also be helpful to know what your friend considers as a high stress/ demanding job. If he’s working 70-80 hrs a week all year he can probably do better.

In some cases, not being capable enough in a given role ends up being the primary driver of stress, not external factors.

Depression,Other,a Legal Investigative Analyst 1,7 months,"Reading your story was like a hard shot in the face! WOW! This is exactly me 😯 I too am working on getting myself out of the flipping funk.

It's been a very difficult 4 years for me, COVID arrived & my work in a law firm was not renewed (I was contract), my sweet Mama had a heart attack & its accompanying surgery, trying my best to care for Mama while trying to hold a full time job which proved impossible. After I was let go by the last firm in 2021, I just threw up my hands and decided to center all my energy on Mama. (We lived together ❤) Caring for Mama totally by myself since 2021 was beyond hard. She & I cried so many times because she felt like a burden. I told her that she cared for me when I was a baby abd now it's my turn to care for her now that she can't. I was proud to care for her 🥰

She left April 21, 2022. 😭😭😭

Now I had the overwhelming grief 💔to live through as well as previously diagnosed major depression & fibromyalgia symptoms.
I wanted to hang myself so damn many times. But I didn't because Mama would have been SO PISSED at me for taking my life.

I moved back to a city I really loved. I have a FANTASTIC job with the FAA and each day I am healing. It's still difficult and slow but I talk to Mama every day and she gives me the encouragement I need.

I WILL SURVIVE! ❤🤞",8,9/20/24 21:06,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/i-dont-normally-post-about-my-experience-with-depression-and-anxiety-but-i-wanted-to-share-a-new-things-in-case-it-helps-anyone,1,71,2209

Depression,Author,a Customer Success Manager 1,7 months,"…and the PCP prescribed meds. He also recommended taking some time off work. I asked my boss at the time who was a C-Level exec for a LOA and was transparent about what I was going through and he refused. I asked if I could work remotely for a while and he said no (this was pre-Covid). I did not know at the time about LOA procedures through HR for medical reasons and I felt that my only option was to resign. So I did.

I took a year off, tried to heal, tried to practice self care, and even thought I was going to retire and live off of investments or find a less stressful role.

Fast forward to 4 years later. I took a role that was not the right level and the wrong fit at Amazon and have therefore struggled to fit in and feel valued. I did it because after a year off I felt that I needed to be employed again (again because I drive a lot of my self worth from my work). I stay because I still define myself by success at work…even though that feels elusive in my current job.

It’s been a real struggle. I’ve been working remotely since 2021. I’ve self isolated. Not seen family much. Not taken care of my health much. Struggled to get out of bed often. Or on the flip side overworked myself to the point of burnout often. My meds made me feel like a zombie with constant brain fog. I would work myself to exhaustion all week then collapse on the weekend and not do anything to live life. There’s been a lot of binging.

This year I’m changing this. I’m trying to take control again. I started with doing all my medical checkups. I’m finding my self care providers - it’s rough but I’m trying. I’ve planned a trip to see family. I’m reconnecting with friends. I’m still trying to find a therapist I connect but I’ll get there.

I can’t tell you what exactly made the difference but some time at the end of last year I just had to decide that I didn’t want to languish my life away and I had to muster up the willpower to move forward. Every day is still a challenge, honestly. I’ve been paying for a gym membership since January and I went in to register but I haven’t actually gone back to workout. But I know I need to and I will.

Try to schedule the heck out of your days …not to fill up your days but to get at least one major thing done each day for work and for yourself. Make your PCP appointments, go see your dentist, show up to therapy, call your mom, take over a gift for your neighbor and chat a while. I schedule time for me in my calendar now vs. filling all available time with work trying to please others. Just try and little by little you’ll see the light.

It is very hard. I know. But there’s light …",24,9/20/24 21:06,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/i-dont-normally-post-about-my-experience-with-depression-and-anxiety-but-i-wanted-to-share-a-new-things-in-case-it-helps-anyone,1,71,2212

Depression,Other,JLL 1,7 months,"I have a chronic, debilitating back condition and have been dealing with it for a couple of years. At the end of last year I suffered some depression on top of continuous pain. I was also dealing with a 90 year old father who had dementia. I took FMLA for 3 months to try to get myself together. When I returned to work I was given a PIP and expected to do 3 months of work in a week, which was impossible. I was also denied the short term disability that the company offers because they didn't think my depression was ""serious enough"" to warrant disability, although many days I was unable to get out of bed. I had documentation from my PCP, who put me on some antidepressants that have now started to work. I also had documentation from my orthopedic specialist, and the doctor from pain management. I didn't receive any pay for 2-1/2 months! Then my father passed away late last week. There were no flowers from JLL like my brother's company sent. I am now taking my bereavement days, but I fully expect to be terminated after I catch up my work that laid untouched for 3 months. I also happen to be African American.

I had always heard that JLL was one of the best companies for diversity. I don't know if all companies take depression seriously. Lord if I didn't have effective medication, I shudder to think how I would feel now after the treatment I received from JLL. Consider it fortunate that your company was compassionate and understanding. I have not received the same treatment. I am a middle level manager and I saved our client over half a million dollars in 2023, so I was obviously doing my job and doing it well. Good luck with your depression. I hope we can both stay on the sunny side of the street.",4,9/20/24 21:06,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/i-dont-normally-post-about-my-experience-with-depression-and-anxiety-but-i-wanted-to-share-a-new-things-in-case-it-helps-anyone,1,71,2217

As someone who is diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety myself, I am not.

These are things that helped me, notice I DID mention therapy because that's also helped me. OP is ALREADY medicated. What other treatment if not medication and or therapy is there left for me to talk about?

You're right, lifestyle choices aren't a substitute for treatment. But OP also wanted advice on this as it relates to Consulting and there are certainly choices we make in our careers that can make mental illness worse. I was answering the question from that perspective.","1

Depression,Other,a Director 1,5 months,"My son is a teenager and is going through some stuff at the moment. As a parent, I can listen, help reframe, and otherwise create a safer space for him to process. We've had to have way too many open conversations on depression and suicide for the past two months.

This weekend, we went and visited my inlaws, who have been battling a combination of cancer for one and serious mobility issues (and surgical recovery) for the other. He got on this very heavy death joke kick - like inappropriate level of joking. We redirected several times and kind of smoothed things over conversation wise. In the car on the way home, I once again reaffirmed that we loved him and that we cared about him. And then I pointed out that in 5, 10, or 15 years from now, his grandparents were going to be dead. And I asked him how he felt about that. I then said they've had a good life. They've seen their kids succeed. They've built relationships with their grandkids. Every demarcation of success they have achieved. He was upset, I could hear it (I was driving). I told him that everyone in the car would be upset. It will affect all of us when it comes.

I then asked him how he thought it would affect all of us if he died tomorrow. I said that it wouldn't just be the death of someone who had led a fulfilled life, but it would be the end of all his potential - and that no matter what, the question of what I could have done - what any of us could have done - to help him understand how much he is loved and how much a hole like that would be left in our lives.

Depression,Other,Authora Manager,4 months,"I say this as a working wife also with long run anxiety and depression that I’m slowly getting past: you are powerless. It’s not your job to fix her. In some ways that may be part of her issue, is wanting full autonomy to direct and impact her life rather than being in SAHM passive caretaker mode.

For me the worst part was feeling trapped. If you take that lens are there things that you can do to grant her real freedom. For example, a week away alone to sleep and read books, or a spa/ yoga / meditation alone for a week? (Where you get backup childcare or take a week off work yourself to mind the littles).

Getting space to feel like herself again and release the trapped feeling might go a long way.

Or it might not, because everyone is different!

They can turn into very toxic echo chambers, and some women on those forums romanticize being a SAHM while criticizing anyone who doesn't want to live that way. If you're wife knew she was going to be a SAHM, it's likely she started following accounts that promote that lifestyle, and algorithms on social media could be flooding her feeds with that type of content.

It’s neither unethical nor inappropriate to mention to your manager that you are suffering from any medical condition. Both anxiety and depression are considered disabilities at our firm.

You have a point in terms of setting expectations that your manager is not there to solve your problems, but they are required to provide accommodations for medical conditions. It’s okay to discuss this during performance conversations. The way I would handle this is “how is your condition impacting your work? what can I do to help you, what do you need from me”.

Depression,Other,an Operations Manager 1,6 months,"If there wad a miscommunication, I doubt it was from you/your co-workers not understanding and more from your manager not explaining properly. Make sure you keep records of all interactions, good, bad and neutral. Your manager seems like acting like an insolent child, so make sure you keep yourself safe from retaliation, even if you didn't do anything wrong. Bad managers blame everyone else but themselves for any issues. Before you talk to HR make sure you have documentation.

I agree with most here that HR is NEVER for you, they are for the company, but if you feel like things are coming to a head where a confrontation with this manager is inevitable, it's good to go to the HR (supported by your detailed documents and records) to have things on file becasue your days are numbers there anyway after that.

Depression,Other,an Associate 2,a year,"Focus on the things you can control for now, even though it seems ridiculously hard. Recommend seeing a therapist but for me a lot of it was actually burnout / physical / circumstantial. I also required a change of scene to snap out of it when it was circumstantial (meds and therapy did not work as well in that case)

Hydration, sleep, vitamin D (level should be close to 100; this was actually a huge one for my depression), magnesium glycinat/citrate, vitamin B (I sometimes get IVs with B12 and glutathione which seems to help with burnout-induced depression), fruits, healthy meat, greens and good olive oil seem to help.

Depression,Other,an Associate 2,a year,"Adding that you can also get B12 IM injections at Reviv clinics (in NYC) if IV is too time consuming — just make sure you’re also taking vitamin B9 (folic acid) 400 mg and eating a lot of potassium rich foods (banana, avocado, coconut water, spinach etc). This helped more than anything for my attending anxiety / insomnia.

Iron and ferritin is another huge one — but definitely get levels checked before supplementing. When I’m weirdly depressed usually this and / or Vit D is off (not even wildly off, just borderline normal but not close to optimal). There is an Iron Protocol group on Facebook that helped for me.

Sometimes it is indeed just psychological, but my experience has been that it’s actually important to first get the physical stuff checked out as it’s an easy fix, but can’t just be addressed by therapy etc.","3

Depression,Author,Authora Senior Consultant,4 months,"I did, and it was debilitating. One day I did something about it and took a big risk. I quit and went back to school to reset and reengineer my path forward. I was married with a child at the time, so my wife and I had to make significant sacrifices but we powered through it. I was behind my entry class when I restarted but I caught up over time being able to leverage life experience and other skills to make me more valuable. The key was not to worry about what I hadn’t done but to focus on what I could do going forward. This forward focus was critical. I redefined what achievement and victory meant to me, kept humble and worked hard. Over time, things worked out, and they will for you. I look back now and think, “why was I so worried?” I realize that is hard to imagine when you are in the middle of it. Also get help - getting out of depression requires assistance from my experience. My spouse was my anchor. Ultimately, the person I learned to bet on was me. Good luck and keep working through it.

I suggest quitting your job and find a career/job that suits you better.

Consulting isn’t for everyone. It is a lot of time on the road, lots of changing projects and priorities, people pulling you in multiple directions, and heavy pressure to prove that you’re somehow “better than” the client who has been doing their job for far longer than you’ve been a consultant.",,9/21/24 9:01,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/has-anyone-suffered-severe-anxiety-and-depression-over-career-choices-theyve-made-any-advice-to-move-forwards-have-done,1,88,2576

Depression,Other,a Product Manager 1,9 months,"Hey there,

This is my first time responding on a thread, but I read your message on my notifications, and just wanted to let you know you are not alone, and I hear you. I’ve experienced the same. Our jobs are so demanding right? The expectation is we are jr “GM’s” and own the success of our product; good or bad.

I’ve had many tears in my eyes, face in my hands, moments. Remember this; although important, what we are doing isn’t saving lives nor is it more important than your health, and your values. Take walks often, breathe and focus on the body and breathe, drink tons of water, and rest as much as you can when you reach your bed. Control what’s controllable. Take care of yourself, high five the mirror, make sure your internal dialogue is loving and proud; you got this. Money is always the resource of so many emotions, fear and anxiety are the top, but just remember; it won’t kill you.

Always keep your eye out for other opportunities on the side, even when you get a break, search your phone, side hustle, do whatever it takes to align your life with your values and your health. We are capable of extraordinary things, if we give ourselves a chance to believe. Most times we are our only road block.

You got this. I’m here with you! Together! Happy Holidays 🎁

All my best,

Depression,Other,a WEB Developer 1,9 months,"Damn, I feel this. Sending some healing vibes.

I went through this years back as Director of Product, and the effects are still here. My entire operations side of the org was in dire straights from poor executive leadership, dropped off one by one. I was the final team member remaining, including after a cofounder left.

New boss, the other cofounder, promptly took my engineering hires from me and psychologically abused me while dismantling my position over 6 weeks. Fired me without cause weeks before the holidays mid lockdowns, kids in remote schooling, months after an eviction from new owners of the home we'd lived in for 13 years.

Depression,Other,a Product Manager 4,9 months,"You have time to look for jobs. Yes, you do. +1 to taking care of yourself, but hear me out.

Everything going on has you questioning your skills, how good you are and what value you can bring to the team.

Your work environment is very unhealthy, but it’s also impacted how you view yourself and what you have to offer. So the problem is not that you don’t have time to apply to new jobs, you don’t think there’s a point. “Who’s going to hire me when I can’t even get my current job right?” “I don’t have results to add to my resume” “I’ve done nothing tangible in the last x months”

Because those are the thoughts occupying your head, applying to new roles seems pointless. Not that I’ve laid it out, it seems obvious no? “Of course I have value”, “of course I have something tangible”, etc etc.

Now that you’re aware of it, watch how easier it feels to submit an application to another job. You’ve reminded yourself that you do have value to give, and you’re realizing your current work environment is in no way a reflection of the work that you can do.

Depression,Other,an Attorney 1,9 months,"In undergrad and part of law school. It was awful. Couldn’t sleep. Couldn’t eat. Crying all the time. Couldn’t get out of bed many days in a row to the point I was failing classes in undergrad or dropping them with W’s. I think the only thing that really snapped me out of it besides therapy and trying 10+ different medicines that didn’t work or made me feel worse was exploring something else and finding something else I was passionate about. I went to study abroad and haven’t felt that way since. It gave me a purpose and helped me finally slow down the pace of constantly feeling the need to achieve.

Don’t know if you can afford a drastic change (and it was different for me as I was pre-career), but it may be worth exploring. A time you don’t have to work. A time you’re not in a rush. I don’t think a single month off (as you’d get in between jobs) would be enough.

Make sure you’re in the office at least 3x a week even if you’re at a firm with no requirement. Make a point of attending all visible but not compulsory things held in the office and use the opportunity to speak to seniors that are there.

Depression,Other,Intelsat 1,8 months,"You should answer honestly. Only reason I wouldn’t is if you’re already getting support from somewhere else and you just don’t want to deal with the additional questioning (which may stop at “I already have professional mental health support”). If you aren’t, highly encourage to get ahead of anything with a therapist. Doesn’t mean you have a formal diagnosis since so much of this is normal, but either way, parents can always benefit from additional support for the sake of self and kids.

Depression,Other,an Associate Attorney 1,8 months,"You should answer honestly, but if you’re more comfortable can raise it with your OB or primary care if you have an appt coming up with them.

I’d start reaching out to therapists on your own or call your doctor of choice, let them know you’ve been having a harder time lately and would like a recommendation for who to contact and ask if they have resources/referrals.

With my first, I had PPA/PPD that started after I went back to work, when LO was 4 months or so I’d say. I already had a mental health team in place though, so I was luckily in that I could address it quickly.

Bottom line, whether through your pediatrician, a doctor, or on your own, try to get some help asap.

Depression,Other,a PMO Specialist 1,2 months,"Both meds can make you sleepy so it’s probably best to take after dinner.
Antidepressants can affect libido and weight, and can cause digestive issues, nausea, etc. If you’re a female, be aware that blood pressure meds shouldn’t be taken if you are on birth control. Look up contraindications for both drugs because PCP doctors overlook them all the time. I always start a new medication on Friday night or Saturday morning so any side effects don’t impact my work week.
You should really consider addressing the root cause by looking for another job rather than taking meds for an indefinite period of time.

Depression,Author,an Administrative Assistant - Operations 1,5 months,"Here are some ways to manage depression:

1. Stay in touch: Don't withdraw from life. Socializing can improve your mood. Keeping in touch with friends and family means you have someone to talk to when you feel low.
2. Exercise: There's evidence that exercise can help lift your mood. If you haven't exercised for a while, start gently by walking for 20 minutes every day.
3. Challenge negative thoughts: Are your distortions true? Or do they just feel real? Are you taking into account the evidence? Does it help to think this way? Try to limit rumination by being more aware when it happens and redirecting yourself by thinking or doing something more helpful.
4. Set realistic goals: Rather than tackle a goal on a large scale, break it down so it is smaller and more manageable. Celebrate micro-successes and build on them.
5. Reduce procrastination: Try to do things a little at a time rather than avoid tasks all together. This can promote a sense of accomplishment and self-efficacy
6. Avoid big decisions: Contemplating or acting on major life decisions should be avoided until your cognitive and decision-making abilities are sharper
7. Engage in healthy joyful activities: Try to enjoy the small things like listening to a good song, reaching out to a friend, dancing in your own space, or a cup of tea
8. Stay connected: It may feel hard but keep friends and family close. Try to explain what you are experiencing and how they can help. Know you are not alone.
9. Practice self-compassion: Be kind to yourself and avoid being harsh or overly critical
10. Seek professional help: If you are experiencing severe depressive symptoms, seek professional help. Signs of severe depression include symptoms that are intense, paralyzing, and/or unrelenting (lasting months), inability to care for your daily basic needs or attend to your duties or relationships, symptoms accompanied by substance abuse, self-harm, and/or suicidal thoughts.

Remember, depression is treatable, and there are steps you can take to cope with it. It's essential to seek professional help if you are experiencing severe symptoms.",4,9/21/24 10:04,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/does-anyone-deal-with-depression-how-do-you-manage-it-with-the-demands-of-work-im-struggling,1,108,2889

Depression,Other,an Associate Consultant 1,6 months,"I have. I wish I had done it a lot sooner though. I was burned out badly at my last job and taking a day off here or a week off there did not helped me. Always came back to more work and was always playing catch up. Seemed never ending and very hopeless and depressing. I could not see the light or way out of it. Ended up getting very visible and loud panic or anxiety attack at work due hostile work environment that triggered my PTSD. My promotion, raise and bonus was off the table. Company didn’t know what to do with me as they couldn’t immediately fire me due to what had happened.

It’s not your fault if your teammates have additional work they need to do when you’re out. It’s the company’s or department managers’s fault and responsibility for not having enough people on the team and over burdening you and others. Please get rid of this guilt you have and the mind set that you are somehow responsible for what happens to your team or company. Ultimately you are only responsible for yourself and your well being. The same way the company will only look out for itself.

I needed deep rest over an extended period of time without the pressure of not having any money to fall back on. I didn’t end up taking a leave of absence at my old job where I got the panic/anxiety attack. I ended up leaving and immediately starting a new job. I could not perform well during my first 2-3 weeks at my new job and applied for short term disability after I got a note from my therapist. Used up all my PTO (17 paid days) from my new job and then my short term disability kicked in after that. In total I was out for a good 3 months before I went back to my new job. I saw an improvement in my symptoms, mood and in the way I was managing myself daily. From there, it took my another 10-15 months to reset and recover to a point where I was at 60-70-% functioning capacity. And I had to build on this very slowly to avoid another crash or episode.

Burn out is real and the longer you keep delaying what you need (maybe rest, rehab, meds, travel, spiritual needs, counseling, you may not know what you need), the more intense the crash will be when you reach breaking point and the longer it will take to recover from it personally and professionally. Taking time off can be the first step in figuring out what you need.","2

Depression,Other,an Associate Consultant 1,6 months,"Also, looking out for yourself becomes even more important if you don’t have the support you need at work or in your personal life which was my situation. I don’t see parents feeling guilty for taking maternity and paternity leaves. I don’t see my team feeling guilty for taking long vacations or extended leaves when their pet or extended family member passes away. Everyone’s reason is valid and not any more or less important than yours. Put yourself first. No one except your doctor and you have to know why you’re taking a medical leave. Your doctors note should be sufficient for HR. Not even your team or boss needs to know why you’re on leave.","2

Depression,Other,a Manager 1,3 months,I’ve been there. Honestly you have to take yourself out of the rut. No one else can. In psychology they teach you that habits form with 30 days. If you’re depressed that means this is now engrained in you. Which means you need to force yourself to think positively and push away any negative thoughts (believe me the universe is going to have a field day with you trying to bring you down while you’re trying to be positive lol she a btch but you have to make yourself push through) other people can’t do this for you.

For me, it was structured physical and social activity, resting and deep cleaning/decluttering.

Find the 1-3 things you want to focus on during your leave.

Some ideas…

1. structured rest and physical activity. So having good sleep hygiene, daily or weekly physical activity like swimming or dancing classes or boxing (class pass is a great option)

2. Having healthy food with doctor recommended vitamins for boosting mood. I use ashwagandha and mushroom coffee for my adhd.

3.Weekly life/career coaching. Check out mission collaborative and 80000hours.org

4. Weekly or regular your doctor appointments (physical and mental health) appointments. I had weekly support groups with other women with similar experiences and PTSD and weekly one on one therapy along with biweekly visits to my psych for meds.

Sometimes working earlier than usual helps to minimize distractions and setting my phone on ‘work mode’ and I put my Teams on Do not disturb or on a call modes, and tell my team that I’m working in something and probably won’t answer right away (to lower the expectation of answering fast).

Depression,Other,a Consultant 1,3 months,"There's a big rabbit hole for this stuff, and I think not much is FDA approved, which in many cases is probably because it's not profitable to fund the approval process, but does mean that there's not as good of data as some people would want.

Along those lines, you should be cautious about taking the word of some online rando. I learned most my stuff from Reddit forums like r/nootropics. Since they're all online randos, I followed the convos to understand the consensus on things, and then tried out the substances in small amounts at a time. That way I could safely-ish verify the things I was reading. I believe that Piracetam and most of the racetams have been deemed quite safe, by medical researchers, but you should double check these things for yourself.

If you want a direction to start off in, try the racetam family. Start with Piracetam, and then branch out to a few others like aniracetam, pramiracetam, phenylpiracetam. Huperzine A is worth a shot. For wakefuless more than focus, there is (ar)modafinil. And the list goes on. To discover more, you can simply browse around on Nootropics Depot for stuff that interests you. Before buying, read more about it elsewhere. The Reddit forums are a good place to start, and they often lead you to the relevant medical studies, etc.

I think part of the mechanism of action of some of these is to speed up the brain's usage of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, so it is often beneficial to pair with a choline supplement.

Some of these chemicals are quite potent and require a scale to measure doses. A lot of people have gotten way more into the weeds about it than I have, and also I haven't kept up with any recent developments.
It's certainly a course with potential, but here's some advice you'll often see on forums about noots and biohacking: First make sure your other health stuff is taken care of as well as you can manage it: diet (vitamins), exercise, SLEEP, etc. Then you can start bringing in other stuff.

If you are currently taking any other medication, or have particular health issues, you should proceed with more caution.","1

Depression,Other,a Consultant 1,3 months,"Oh, also quite worth considering are various cannabinoids, like CBG. This and others like CBD do not have the intoxicating effects of the primary cannabinoids, but can still have some very useful effects. CBD has a well-known anxiolytic effect, as do botanicals like kava and kratom. For some people (like myself), anxiety is at the core of procrastination, and so it can be helpful to have levers to pull to modulate the anxiety too.

In fact, even some of the cannabinoids that many people find intoxicating can actually be helpful for certain people in managing their ADHD, autism, etc.

I myself have found a lot of value with these. But it is a road that probably most medical professionals would not advise you to go down, or at least they won't the solutions that medical professionals offer for your problems.","1

Depression,Other,a Consultant 2,3 months,"I was also diagnosed at 27 with ADHD, the last year for me has been a huge journey of self discovery. I've taken the time to really learn the condition, the challenges, the benefits (there are some!) but also the co-morbid conditions and coping strategies (anxiety, OCD, depression etc)

By increasing my education, its allowed me to stop masking certain behaviours (freeing up bandwidth and energy) but also be significantly kinder to myself about my flaws, which has improved my overall MH.

Making key people aware (like my manager and some internal support groups) I have a better network of people to ask for help, which I've always struggled with. A good manager really makes the difference for me - it feels like a safe space where I'm not judged for needing different help.

I've also begun studying to be a Coach through a work programme.

I can only speak for myself. If I were you, I would spread things out as much as possible so that days aren't as heavy and become bite-sized as opposed to giant chomps. Maybe work in some breaks? Deep-breathing exercises tend to help me.

Slow down and focus on depression- it’s a killer",5,9/21/24 10:09,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/im-struggling-with-depression-and-its-impacting-my-work-quite-a-lot-cant-get-basic-tasks-done-on-time-end-up-working-late-because,1,118,3066
Depression,Other,an Associate Consultant 1,6 months,"I say this with the best of intentions. Please drop the idea of being a high performer while struggling mentally. In the long run, you can’t keep up with both goals at the same time. There are people who are high achievers and manage their depression and other health conditions. Key is they’ve learned to manage their health condition and get results. Often, this can take time, trial and error and a supportive manager and work environment. My suggestion is to try a few therapists and then stick with one whose approach works for you. Try in person or virtual group therapy or support groups as when others in the same boat witness your story, it can healing for the mind. To be heard and understood consistently helps with healing. Be open to managing sleep and mood thru doctor prescribed medication before you work on your goal of managing your high performance.

Make sure you are sleeping well and getting at least 8 hours of deep rest. It may take a few days to a few months till you or your body feels less tired right upon waking up. Give yourself a lot of grace and be kind to yourself while trying to have routine. Have a wind down routine (no electronics, black out curtains, calming background music on an app etc. ), wake up routine (deep breathing or prayer or stretching in bed). Make time for some form of daily or regular exercise and healthy nutrition as both are mood boosters. If you have decision fatigue, only do one or two things such as brushing and showering, making your bed. Cleaning the house, laundry, dishes, healthy food theoretically can be outsourced to people and businesses that offer such services. Don’t feel bad for spending money on these things to make your depression more manageable. Most importantly seek connection with yourself, nature and if you feel up for it, seek connection with those who understand what you’re going thru and can offer you comfort. Please don’t waste your valuable time and energy on any other people or things that don’t help you on your wellness journey.

I cannot recommend telling your employer about your condition. But if it takes the pressure off for you, then submit a doctor’s note with a request for specific accommodations due to your health condition only to HR. I hope you are as ambitious if not more with your mental well being as you are with work. Wishing you good luck and fortitude in your wellness journey.",11,9/21/24 10:09,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/im-struggling-with-depression-and-its-impacting-my-work-quite-a-lot-cant-get-basic-tasks-done-on-time-end-up-working-late-because,1,118,3067

Depression,Other,a Director 1,6 months,"Do talk to your doctor about it, as a diagnosis and pharmaceutical treatment may be helpful.

Then clean whole food eating throughout the day (just cut out the processed stuff and eat Whole Foods you like… meat, veggies, fruit, beans, limited grains). If you can sauna in the evening. Then protect / improve your sleep (regular schedule, don’t eat for a few hours before your bed time). Plus if you drink more than a couple drinks a week cut that down.

Depression,Other,a Customer Service Representative 1,5 months,"I have to have my anxiety in check with meds before I add any ADHD medication into the mix. If you decide to try meds, which I would highly recommend giving a shot (coming from someone who's life was probably set back at least 15 years because of being hesitant about taking meds).

If you decide to try, just try the absolute smallest dose available of an ADHD medication. Sometimes they will try to talk you out of the smallest dose. Don't let them! I guess they have their reasons, but I have just found it a waste of time and mental health to try to cope with doses that start off too high.

Start slow and listen to your body & mind. Keep a journal of your thoughts and how they change. And finding a way to measure whether you're more or less effective at what matters.

I have found that when starting new meds I can often second/triple guess my behavior, sometimes losing sight of who I am now and who I was before. So I find that I can get grounded through creating reference points throughout my medicated and unmedicated experiences so I can keep them in perspective. Some meds make me feel unlike myself, and those are the meds I decide not to continue. However, I think some of those side-effects were from taking too strong of a dose too soon.

Anyways, my point is trying meds is the only way to figure out if they are for you. Plus stimulants go through your system relatively fast and don't have the same kind of withdrawal you can have from other meds that take time to lower/increase the dose. Try the meds a couple days on your weekend because sometimes it can take a few days/weeks to acclimate. Maybe just take the meds on the weekends at first? Just spitballing here. Also taking magnesium when you take your meds might help. I've heard that in an ADHD audiobook about natural remedies. That magnesium can help curb some of the side effects. And I absolutely have found that to be true.",1,9/21/24 10:12,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/wanted-to-start-medication-to-manage-my-adhd-but-i-also-struggle-with-anxiety-and-depression-and-take-prozac-for-it-my-psych,1,126,3173
Depression,Other,a Vice President 1,4 months,"From my understanding, it’s about 50/50 people who respond better to therapy vs meds. ADHD coaching is usually provided by a therapist that is trained on ADHD.

ADHD is often combined with anxiety is depression. Some doctors seem to prefer to try treating ADHD first, as stimulants are quicker to see if it alleviates symptoms. Whereas some meds for anxiety / depression might take a few weeks or months to start working.

I think it is fair to say adhd meds may impact your mood. But I also think it’s worth exploring if it’s helpful. You can always ask these questions with your doctor.",1,9/21/24 10:12,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/wanted-to-start-medication-to-manage-my-adhd-but-i-also-struggle-with-anxiety-and-depression-and-take-prozac-for-it-my-psych,1,126,3174
Depression,Other,an Associate 1,4 months,"There are plenty of things you can try before meds and yes, coaching can help. The thing with ADHD is that we’re all different, especially if you have other things mixing in with it like depression and anxiety. I deal with these 3, so does my son… but even then as individuals it’s still different. I’m in my mid 40s and off all meds and functioning well with things I’ve learned over the years. My teen only takes meds for ADHD. He was diagnosed at 4 and didn’t take meds until 8. We ruled all other things out.

Not sure who diagnosed you, but sharing this info for anyone reading. A regular MD should not be the end all be all for a neurological disorder, too many things have the same symptoms and symptoms can overlap. They may suspect it, but in a firm believer that a neurological diagnosis should come from as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or a neurologist as it’s their speciality. ADHD is over-diagnosed, under-diagnosed, and misdiagnosed depending on where people are located. There was occupational therapist work done, then improved, there were major dietary changes that improved symptoms significantly (removing gluten… and strict about it because it’s not just not eating bread or pasta, it’s in sauces and spice mixes, etc). We tried a number of things and everything helped, some more than others. Diet was definitely the biggest.

I managed my anxiety and depression from therapy when I was younger to self help books when I was older and changed the way I think o more positive (first one was the secret). My son recently went thru a round of therapy that worked on positive thinking and positive self image for sports, but can be applied to school and outside of school and it’s helped him.

We still have certain feelings sometimes and we work thru those. I’m not saying anyone needs to do all this, just that we’re all different and there are things that do help some people besides meds or besides just meds. My son is only on a med for ADHD and that’s for school and driving.

I also agree you should start lowest dose possible. I have heard from many sources of someone just throws you on something because you’re an adult and have a certain weight, that’s not how it goes. Meds helped when I needed them in school, I don’t need them now. I agree they can be life changing, but there’s other stuff that may help as well. A pill is not a fix all, it only helps as well. There’s days that my kid still has a struggle with a symptom or two because they are not a magic fix. 😇",1,9/21/24 10:12,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/wanted-to-start-medication-to-manage-my-adhd-but-i-also-struggle-with-anxiety-and-depression-and-take-prozac-for-it-my-psych,1,126,3175

Depression,Other,Authora Technician,9 months,"Hi,
From 2013 - 2019 I worked for a company in Seattle that shipped me out to the Bering Sea on a factory vessel after staying in Alaska for sometime and multiple contracts I left.
From 2020 - 2022 I worked for a company that gave me my first step into tech. Great pay and I worked long hours. Literally filled out over 400 applications before I found them. I learned so much and added it to my resume. These guys dealt with Cisco solutions and machine repairs.

While I was working as a technician I was also obtaining a General Education.

That’s not all though I was even enrolled in an IT undergrad program.

They seemed to enjoy me just being myself. I talked about what I enjoyed and didn’t enjoy at my last jobs. I communicated that I was ready to learn and even spent time that I was out of work earning certificates.

I filled my gaps with learning and honestly, HR said, “ You can’t find many young people like you.” Basically, just be yourself and a company won’t hound you with crazy hard questions. Tell them what you know and try not to think of it as an interview. This approach is actually what I suggest and the one that worked for me.

I even had to take a test and they told me hey it’s a little outdated so if you don’t know something it’s okay. We mostly talked about my readiness to learn.

Find what inspired you about your past jobs and experience and communicate that.",5,9/21/24 10:13,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/hi-i-was-out-of-work-for-a-little-over-a-year-i-spent-that-time-earning-certifications-and-learning-more-and-more-with-all-the,1,129,3214

Depression,Other,an Associate 3,6 months,"Are you seeing a doctor? Please please make sure you’re getting help. On top of seeing a doctor, there are so many things that can be helpful.

Totally understand the concern about how others will view it, but definitely don’t let that stand in the way of getting help.

Not sure if your stress is from being overloaded with work or from the depression/personal stuff, but in my experience, telling your team that you are overloaded (so long as others aren’t equally as swamped) or that you have some personal stuff going on at the moment (you don’t need to specify) and that you’re super stressed because of it, they’re pretty understanding and helpful.

As someone else suggested, you can always consider FMLA. I am always skeptical of HR, but I think HR actually does keep it 100% confidential. I say this as someone who needs a work accommodation, and I was super concerned that HR was going to tell people about my medical condition, but it seems they really kept it confidential.

I too am questioning my education path, but I also know that climbing towers is what I want to do. I want to travel the country and see godly views from a birds eye view.

Depression,Other,,4 months,"My daughter was forced to work as a barista for years following college and finally got a job in her field of study a few months ago. She had to relocate to St Louis but don't be afraid or unopen to relocate as that may be the only way to get a start in your field of study. I've been a truck driver for 35 years and have been trying to start a new career for a year now while remaining unemployed due to health reasons without any local offers and my wife refuses to relocate. So, I began the slow process of going on disability today. I obtained an associates degree in computer science in 2003 but the paycut to start a career in the IT field was far to large so I stayed in the trucking industry. The moral of the story is don't wait to long, be unwilling to accept less money, or to be unwilling to relocate as you may end up with a huge amount of regret as I look back and at 58 there are very few options left for me. I wish you all the best of luck in your new career and don't give up!",6,9/21/24 10:15,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/post-grad-depression-is-no-joke-its-been-a-full-year-without-finding-work-in-my-field-of-fashion-design-despite-having-a-gwfm-5,1,133,3273

Depression,Other,American University 1,4 months,"I'm so sorry you are having difficulty. My twin sister has your degree. This is her 30 year career ark. She is 50. (I know, I can't believe it has been so long. I feel 35 still).

She was unwilling to move to NY, so she stayed local and sought jobs in the Nashville/Bowling Green/Louisville areas. Long story short, after having to take a series of jobs in retail to pay the bills she landed in a shop selling Couture merchandise and moved into store management (3 different stores of increasing size), then into non-profit work as a fund raiser (American Cancer Society) then (Gilda's Club) Chief Philanthropy Officer, and finally Development Director at Gilda's Club.
She loves her work, but she does work all the time.

I tell you this so you can get a sense of how a career trajectory can look. Few people get to go directly into their chosen field-let alone position.

Depression,Author,a SR. Online Community Manager 1,9 months,"I would talk to your doctor and see if maybe you try another ADHD med if they think that might help. Also, talk to them about pairing up with an anti-depressant as well. It's probably a multi-layered issue.

I am on and have been for years an anti-depressant that helps with anxiety, and I was feeling similar. I'm in my mid-forties, female, and lacking energy, among other things. I tested everything and had no issues with hormones or thyroid, and then I was diagnosed with ADHD. So now I am on Adderall XR in the morning and Lexapro in the evening, and I finally feel balanced. My energy is back and I feel so much better.

In my experience, in dealing with depression for almost 30 years, if you aren't treating depression, it really doesn't matter what else you are treating; it will always be the thing that causes the most issues; it is mentally and physically consuming and exhausting. Talk to your doctor, they will be able to help.",4,9/21/24 10:16,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/i-dont-know-if-its-adhd-or-depression-related-but-i-have-zero-energy-even-with-ritalin-i-just-want-to-sleep-all-the-time-zero,1,137,3323

Depression,Author,Ohio Middle School 1,9 months,"It may also be a good time to find a psychologist. Someone who works specifically with ADHD & Depression and to talk about what is going on.

In addition, this is the time of year when it is particularly difficult for people who have Seasonal Affect Disorder (SAD). You may not be getting enough light. If you find it almost impossible to get out of bed on rainy or dark days, you may want to look into this. The easiest way to help with this is to sit under grow lights several times a day. They have special lights they sell on Amazon for SAD or you can buy the white “grow light” light bulb and put it in a lamp that will shine on you while you are sitting near it. It can’t hurt and you may find you start feeling better.

Finally, if you go in to check your hormones, have them check your ferritin (specific iron level that can cause excessive sleepiness if you are to low), your B levels and your folate levels. B effects energy and folate effects your mental health.
I found out I don’t absorb/process folic acid so I was really struggling for a bit. Started taking L-methylfolate ( you can get this as a prescription or in Smarty Pants vitamins-check the label) and it made a big difference in my mood and energy.

Well he was telling me this information and I asked/requested he email me the details because I have a hard time remembering things… and what he did next triggered my BPD, and came off like he didn’t believe me- there goes my anxiety, and my major depressive disorder and my BPD makes my emotions flip like a switch and are very very intense.

It’s hard when people invalidate my feelings, requests for a SIMPLE accommodations of as stated above most aren’t difficult either, and they know I have to set alarms to make sure I don’t forget…

Be onto what he said to me: what is 2 + 2- I said 4, and said you don’t have memory issues, and I don’t want you to share the possible plan until it is finish- I have NO issues in not sharing emails with people outside the intended email.

Oh and this same guy was the one who told my manager that she’s having a mental health crisis and was having super strong “thoughts” and he told her it wasn’t that bad to take a walk and come back as your staff doesn’t need to see you like this.

Having ☠️ thoughts is not a just brush it off thing 😑🤬 I was so mad when she told me that was said to her…

Depression,Other,a Senior Director 1,a year,"You’re definitely not a burden.

Find outlets.

One great booster when feeling depressed is to be grateful. I like to make a list of what I’m grateful for. Sounds very corny, but it makes a massive improvement in my mood.

The list starts out slow-ish, but once you start going, you can list over a hundred things with ease.

Some of my favorite ‘go-tos’ might sound aggressive, but they’re true. Things like “I’m so fortunate to have all of my limbs!” (Sorry for any readers that don’t. Sorry sorry.) But I think… if I lost my legs in a car accident tomorrow, literally NONE of my current problems would mean shit today! I’d be BEGGING the universe to send me back to yesterday’s problems. We take it for granted. I’m so so so fortunate to have all of my limbs. I can walk my depressed ass to the fridge and grab a beer, and I’m so lucky I can do that.

I definitely don’t want to do the “whataboutism” thing. You can be very fortunate in ways, and your problems still matter! But, personally, when I stop and really take note of all the awesome things I have. “Born in the US, have people who love me, have big blue eyes, not deathly allergic to anything, working vehicle”… whatever. It makes me so so so much happier and helps me to kick the depression.

Maybe that exercise would help you.

Good luck! It does get better!",10,9/21/24 10:18,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/im-trying-my-best-not-to-push-people-away-but-my-depression-keeps-making-me-feel-like-im-a-burden,1,141,3376

In my case, it’s tough love with my depressed friend. I tell them, if they want the cold practical truth, come to me: if they don’t want to address their problem and only want to mope, find someone else to lie to you.

It gets tiring and emotionally draining, constantly listening to someone who refuses to do anything to improve their situation. Who only calls or texts to complain about their problems, when you’re going through your own hell.

Social media companies, for all their ills, offer a product that people can access at their leisure. The choice to consume that product (or not) is up to the individual. If people believe social media negatively impacts them, it's their choice to delete their account and remove the app (or not). If parents believe social media is harming their children, it's their responsibility to monitor what their children access online.

Attempting to financially punish social media for being what it is doesn't make sense, except in that it is a get-rich-quick scheme for lawyers.

Interesting logic, I do understand your point as a parenting issue....however it does have some rather interesting consequences.

Alcohol, tobacco, prescription drugs, cars, trucks, the list goes on of products created that people can access at their leisure BUT the one thing that the ones I mentioned have in common was that they all were just as you said at one time but now are ALL regulated in some manner by the government. Will social media follow that same path? If History is to be followed, then it would seem regulation is next logical step.","2

There’s no right answer. And we can’t judge you for that. It’s a crappy situation.

If you do stay with them, just know that you won’t be in a traditional relationship. You’ll be a caretaker.

And if you leave, only the Lord can judge you. It’s very nuanced and contextual. You can’t expect to bear the entire burden.

But at the end, it’s your decision.",1,9/21/24 10:24,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/has-anyone-experienced-or-heard-of-a-relationship-surviving-when-one-partner-suffers-from-severe-depression-and-is-unable-to,1,153,3535

Depression,Author,an Associate Attorney 1,2 months,"A friend recently divorced her husband over this. He was the one who wasn't working and was depressed. She felt like she was changing and growing as a person but he was stagnant. She would come home from work and would have to jump into housework/caretaking. By the end of the day she was exhausted. Her ex-husband grew resentful because he felt like she wasn't communicating with him anymore. She wouldn't tell him about her day and would just make unilateral decisions about things instead of asking him.

She did it because she was just plain tired. Initially, she tried to encourage him to help make these decisions or even to go out and get a hobby or part-time job. But he would refuse and tell her that it was too much for him. He also didn't engage when she'd talk to him about her day.

Depression,Other,a Manager 2,10 months,"My light box is amazing! I keep it on all day. I call it my therapy light. If you can, get outside everyday for at least a few minutes: go on a walk, bathroom break and a quick breath of fresh air, maybe during lunch take a walk outside.

When it does get dark, which it will, establish a routine and do activities that give you peace. For me, it’s working out, cooking and baking, playing with my puppy, FaceTiming with family and friends, watching videos of things that interest me, taking a long shower, lighting a candle and doing skincare.

Depression,Other,a Research Scientist 1,3 months,"I understand your predicament. I am not in your head so i cant say i know exactly how you feel, but from my experience working from home boosted my mood (I was working 80 hour weeks for $2300 a month in grad school and had no interest in my project.) at first. I was deeply depressed and hopeless in school. A lot of messed up things happened. I was in trauma-based therapy, using DBT, Buddhist philosophies, snd EFT, I’ve had TMS, and was on meds. So the switch from misery to freedom with remote work was AMAZING. For a while. And then it ate away at me. I was stuck in the exho chamber of my own overanalytical and critical thoughts and linkedin. I stopped going out. Stopped caring. Detached. I slipped back into depression soon enough snd i had to quit because the depression compounded. I stopped running. I had flexibke hours and i became a vampire. My work doninated my life as it always ram together, there was never a firm stop ro my day, and i worked through the weekends. I was lonlier than ever. I did well for about a year, and now two years after that i am still stuck and still depressed. I miss working with people around. I miss helping people. Stayiing home and applying to jobs without getting out there was my biggest mistake. I wasted years, and just felt worse and worse. I know it sounds easier to work from home, safer, more comfortable. It is at first but ultimately it was extremely detrimental for me. If you do decide to go for it, try not to isolate. Don’t stop going and seeing friends, taking walks, doing things you like. Stay connected to real people because ghe internet can be a gloomy place. Volunteer. All things i shoukd have done.

I don’t know how to get a remote position. I just made one snd didnt give up. I became a freelance scientific and medical consuktsnt snd writer. It was successful but i burned out after a year and now im back to going for an in-person job.

Depression,Other,a Software Engineer 1,3 months,"Context:
1. I am a Sober individual who takes anti depressants and anxiety meds.
2. At one point I didn’t get another sponsor when it wasn’t working out with the one I had and instead I drifted away from the program and relapsed
(he had a good program but we were very different people, I was twenty he was sixty something etc)

I take an SSRI for depression/ocd and Buspirone (not addictive and isn’t a benzodiazepine) for anxiety

Alcoholics Anonymous: Ch 9 The Family Afterward - Page 133
^
This does indeed justify seeking professional help.

I don’t know what anxiety medication your taking and no alcoholic should tell you what medication to take.

However you probably should go to an addictions specialized psychiatrist. Buspirone helps the same way Xanax does but it doesn’t get you fucked up.

When I was taking Xanax for my anxiety while trying to be sober the truth was I wasn’t being entirely honest with myself. I did not NEED Xanax/Ativan or whatever I wanted it and ultimately I relapsed anyway and long before that the benzos brought out my addictive behavior and I was like well aren’t I always anxious? What’s wrong with a maintenance dose instead of as needed?

At this stage in my life, working a good program I have also found that I did not need as much medication as I was taking however I suggest you do what your doctor says and don’t play with dosages. And again psych meds does not mean your not sober—run from the people who say this.

The real question is what type of advice do you want? Are you being honest with yourself if you’re taking a benzo? And if you’re taking benzo do you have reservations and do you really want to be sober?

These are questions only you can answer.",3,9/21/24 10:27,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/i-think-i-need-a-new-sponsor-this-is-upsetting-to-me-as-i-like-my-sponsor-and-theyve-worked-well-with-me-however-i-have-crippling,1,159,3625

More importantly Ive been prescribed adderall, ritalin or something else on and off since 4th grade. I didnt even think about this when posting because it’s never been a debated thing for me.

I do not like to go up. I like to go down. My prescriptions will last me sometimes 3 months because I will take only half sometimes or skip certain days to give myself a break.

So I dont think there’s one answer that will fit every situation. I personally will not take a benzo but I can easily take something else that’s a problem for a large number of people.

If you can find a few good clients, you can get other projects, etc. from them. And good reviews are a must! When I was first on there, it was suggested that even though the pay is crap, do some small jobs to get reviews.

1. I set up an LLC (they’re cheap) and did a couple small projects in my area of expertise. This wasn’t hard to find since I wasn’t looking to make a ton of money. You could even donate some time to a non profit or something.
2. Took a few certifications, online classes, etc. - things that you can put on LinkedIn or a resume. I work in public health so I also stayed on top of industry stuff.
3. Stayed in touch with past colleagues. This is what got me my new job.

Have a narrative ready for why you left but tbh, my interviewers didn’t care very much about my time off since it was my choice and I’d kept active during it.","1

Depression,Other,Authora Prepline Cook,5 months,"Don't EXPECT support - unmet expectations worsen the depression. Seek and take advantage of professional health at all levels. Meds might help, therapy definitely will. The hard thing about mood disorders is that they lie to us and want us 🥀, so we have to action. And mood disorders tell us NOT to act. For a selfish, depressive, pain in the tuchas person like me, it's hard to remember that people from my entire life actually love me and have faith in me and want good things for me.

It's AMAZING to be reminded. And it's my job to stop forgetting!

DEPRESSION TIPS - TRY ONE:

Shower. Not a bath, a shower. Use water as hot or cold as you like. You don’t even need to wash. Just get in under the water and let it run over you for a while. Sit on the floor if you gotta.

Moisturize everything. Use whatever lotion you like. Unscented? Dollar store lotion? Fancy 48 hour lotion that makes you smell like a field of wildflowers? Use whatever you want, and use it all over your entire dermis.

Put on clean, comfortable clothes.
Put on your favorite underwear. Cute black lacy panties? Those ridiculous boxers you bought last christmas with candy cane hearts on the butt? Put them on.

Drink cold water. Use ice. If you want, add some mint or lemon for an extra boost.

Clean something. Doesn’t have to be anything big. Organize one drawer of a desk. Wash five dirty dishes. Do a load of laundry. Scrub the bathroom sink.

Blast music. Listen to something upbeat and dancey and loud, something that’s got lots of energy. Sing to it, dance to it, even if you suck at both.

Make food. Don’t just grab a granola bar to munch. Take the time and make food. Even if it’s ramen. Add something special to it, like a soft boiled egg or some veggies. Prepare food, it tastes way better, and you’ll feel like you accomplished something.

Make something. Write a short story or a poem, draw a picture, color a picture, fold origami, crochet or knit, sculpt something out of clay, anything artistic. Even if you don’t think you’re good at it. Create.

Go outside. Take a walk. Sit in the grass. Look at the clouds. Smell flowers. Put your hands in the dirt and feel the soil against your skin.

Call someone. Call a loved one, a friend, a family member, call a chat service if you have no one else to call. Talk to a stranger on the street. Have a conversation and listen to someone’s voice. If you can’t bring yourself to call, text or email or whatever, just have some social interaction with another person. Even if you don’t say much, listen to them. It helps.

Cuddle your pets if you have them/can cuddle them. Take pictures of them. Talk to them. Tell them how you feel, about your favorite movie, a new game coming out, anything.

May seem small or silly to some, but this list keeps people alive. They’re each small exercises or expressions of self care; of self love. And that's worth fighting for.

At your absolute best you won’t be good enough for the wrong people. But at your worst, you’ll still be worth it to the right ones. Remember that. Keep holding on.

This is what helped me:
1. Speaking with a professional helped. A lot.
2. My HCP recommended meds, but I didn’t want to go that route, so I got a prescription for a CES device.
3. I started exercising again.

Depression,Other,a Product Manager 1,5 months,"I can honestly say I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety at work, esp during an investigation when a more senior person was abusing me in the workplace. To be completely open, this is the time where I searched for God and began in a path towards an actual relationship with Him (if you want, look up an Acts 29 Christian Church near you).
Practical steps, you need to evaluate what to let go of. You have to find faith and strength to make decisions, hard decisions, in order to move on. I realize now that I was put in terrible seasons in my life to help me learn things I needed to learn, not realizing back then. Leave your job if you have to. You’ll be ok. Refresh your mind and take a mental break by actually leaving whatever is unhealthy for you and then being around those who can hold you up while you recover.

Divorced their mother. Married a second time about 5 years later. About a year and a half ago realized I am an alcoholic, went into AA and got sober. I share all of this to say: anything is possible. I can't imagine not having my two sons in my life (they are 23 and 21 now). While all of my ""stuff"" prevented me from being a picture perfect parent, I made an effort, and knowing I had to be present in their lives gave me the strength I often needed to pull through depressive episodes. My children do have some anxiety, and one has diagnosed depression, but I am able to help and assist based on my experiences.

Depression,Other,Nextera Energy 1,a year,I was in really rough shape in my 20s. I had so much anxiety I could not even function. I could only leave the house for 20 minutes at a time. Started working with someone from a treatment perspective who I clicked with and started to get it under wraps. It took a while but at this point I live a pretty normal life. It is key to find someone you feel comfortable with and follow their advice as best as you can.,"2

Go to your doctor to check if you can start taking some supplements to get you started, then commit to one thing, no matter how small i.e. every Monday morning go to the park and listen to 1 podcast episode while you walk. Start looking for courses, charities, sports that you would like to get involved in, get excited about the future.

OP ‐ I agree with the above. I've been laid off for the last few months and haven't been depressed, but I do feel down several days. Have you reached out to your network for help finding a new job? I personally prefer coffee dates over lunch because they can be as short or as long as you want. I also try to get out of the house every day - whether it's to go to a workout class, go to a coffee shop and actually drink coffee there and read or write, or go grocery shopping during the day when it's usually less busy. I find even though I'm laid off, I still have things to do.

Depression,Other,a Senior TR Specialist 1,25d,"If you're comfortable sharing this with your leader, then it would likely be in your own best interest to do so. It would give them a heads up that you may act a bit different for a bit, you can explain to them how they can respond in case of a flare up, it opens the door to accommodation conversations, and (assuming they respond in a supportive way) it will ease some of the anxiety around trying out a new medication because you won't have to ""hide"" a flare up.

We have employees who have shared info on their medication journeys for the same things, and in my experience it's been a positive thing. Most of the time the leader was already aware of the anxiety/depression challenge, and this heads up just means that you're actively trying to manage it - that's all we can ask!

Ignore HR1's comment! Only you get to decide what you do with your life, body, mind, etc. Your question is about whether it's a bad or good idea to tell your leader, not about whether or not to take medication.

Depression,Other,Guidehouse 1,6 months,"I’m so sorry to hear OP! Please let me know if you need a Guidehouse referral. As a mom of two under two, I also struggled with depression right after I had my second.

What helped me get through this hump was first identifying the root of my depression. For me it was significant weight gain and low self esteem and so I forced myself to get a trainer 3x per week. It was hard at first but eventually I had a set schedule that my husband helped me keep. It’s been a rough journey but I feel much better today than I did 4 months ago.

My advice to you is to really put the effort in figuring out your depression trigger and set some manageable goals. Use the support system around you whether that’s a spouse or family member so that you can carve out time out of the day or week to work towards those goals. Recognize that you will have periods of positive days or weeks and then you will hit a wall and that’s okay. You just have to reset and go back to the plan. You got this OP, I’m rooting for you. 🫶🏾",3,9/21/24 10:46,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/im-in-a-perfect-storm-of-anxiety-depression-and-stress-since-i-was-laid-off-and-need-to-balance-all-that-while-caring-for-my,1,192,4002

Yeah, an evaluation is easy and will give you a good idea of why you feel the way you do. Plus, you can get some great options for treatment - not all are medicine.

The key is figuring out what makes your brain tick! You are clearly very bright and articulate, so that will make it pretty simple to solve. I'm confident you can solve this. I mean that genuinely.

Depression,Other,Authora Senior Associate,7 months,"compliments. Her messaging exes and asking them if they ever really loved her in their relationship. Then gaslighting me into thinking that there's nothing wrong with that. That she just wanted ""all the information"".

It's tough. It's tough to feel worthy again. Tough to trust again. Tough to not regret ever getting involved with her. Wondering if I hadn't been so anxious and depressed and codependent if I would have gotten bonuses and raises in 2022 and 2023 (she was still leading me on after we broke up).

Now, I know what you're thinking. Get over it guy. I am, mostly. I only stay in touch occasionally for the cats that she got as kittens while we were together.

I also know what you're thinking, go to therapy my man. I am. But for some context, I've had to work my ass off to get to where I am. I'm making more than my parents made together in a small town when I was growing up. We were middle class in that town but would have been lower class anywhere else and neither of my parents ever went to college. My ex's Dad went to MIT and got his PhD. My ex grew up with all the advantages life could give her and because of her personality she threw me away and focused on work while gaslighting me.

I'm trying now to recoup that lost time. Studying for the PMP. Reading books like ""Win The Day"". Getting involved with other parts of my work. Updating my resume. Growing to the gym. Getting my physical and mental health in order. I'm on my way up. I know I am, but again. Some days are tough. Somedays are really regretful. Somedays are wondering what I can do to get ahead. Somedays I'm angry that this person whose parents can loan her (indefinitely) 30k for a car and I'm trying to figure out how to help my Dad pay for hearing aids. It's not the lost future of her and I but the loss of investing my life in someone who was not ready for a real relationship (we're in our 30s and if you're in the DC area you understand dating here).

So today is a day of regret and anger. But I'll go to the gym. I'll come back and study. I'll finish dog sitting this week bc I want to save the money from a second gig to save for the future. I'll keep pushing. Even though some days are exhausting. Even though I'm taking adderall off use. I'll keep grinding bc that's what I've done and that's what I plan to do.

I know I'm likely screaming into the void and I know some of you will think that I'm some weak dude that doesn't respect himself...and you're right, but I'm learning and I'm working. For those of you that have gone through something similar with an emotionally abusive ex, I know you understand. I know you know the struggle of building back. I know you understand there are hard days.

Depression,Other,"an Infrastructure, Modern Workplace Engineer 1",a year,"My HONEST opinion? 👀 Many mental illnesses are a physical manifestation of some kind of spiritual affliction that frankly you will need deliverance from. As bible believing Christians, we should carry the understanding that no issue is too hard for God to resolve. Jesus gives us a blueprint that some things are a matter of deliverance and the spirit behind that thing need to be cast out. With some kinds of mental health issues, medication is only try to put a bandaid of a symptom as opposed to dealing with the thing causing it. You can take all the medication you want but the spirit behind the mental affliction is still there if you don’t get deliverance. At the same time, I understand that not every Christian carries a certain level of faith or this same level of knowledge and understanding. If the person is someone who they know they dont carry the faith they need in trusting God for deliverance then I completely understand if they take the medication. Faith is not something we can force as much as i wish it was! But the real truth in the situation is that God can heal and deliver us from every kind of mental affliction, it’s just a matter of having this revelation and access to someone who may be able to guide you in deliverance.

I’ve had struggled with depression and other mental health issues myself. I never went to get medication. The day the Lord taught me that it was a spirit behind the issue that needed to be CAST OUT was the same day the Lord delivered me and Ive never had any of those issues since!

Depression,Other,EY 1,a year,"I’ve been a Management Consultant for almost 2 decades. Recently my spouse and I have committed to start a practice to help Child & Adolescents. She’s double-board certified in Adult And CAP.

I’ve worked with her in this space for a long time. I’ve seen first hand when a patient comes in professing to be possessed by or engaging with demons AND patients who are experiencing depression, bipolar and other conditions which require meds. Sometimes patients exhibit issues that require deliverance AND can benefit from the help that meds provide.

The issue is that some church leaders over-emphasize deliverance, fasting and prayer instead of medication due to ignorance. Sometimes only one or the other is required to help the patient… sometimes both. And this is part of a broader issue in SOME churches (especially in under-represented communities). Some local pastors are ill-equipped (personally or just plain lack the resources) to address all issues of their congregants (e.g. providing marital counseling and they have no counseling training, not addressing financial stewardship, etc.)

I view this as an opportunity to educate and advocate within our churches to help people understand that if you take an antibiotic or pain meds for a broken foot or high-blood pressure meds, it’s may not be any different.

Bottomline: Medicine can be used for these disorders, but unlike other fields of medicine, you need a provider who is equally comfortable with identifying and addressing the spiritual issues as well the medical.

Hope this helps.",2,9/21/24 10:50,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/addmental-health-medicine,1,200,4120

My confidence was already knocked down after getting laid off from my dream job out of nowhere, and I couldn't even function properly in interviews. I would literally get to the 6th or 7th round of interviewing and then get rejected, and it absolutely CRUSHED me. It sent me down such a deep depression. What I wish I knew earlier that I couldn't do it alone. Make sure to have a solid support system, and be able to talk to someone about how it's impacted you, because keeping it in was horrible. I needed people to remind me that I was already a great candidate and it just wasn't meant to be. Working out, doing my hobbies, and cooking were things I loved doing that would calm me down. I also invested in a mentor who helped walk me through a reflection of the entire interview experience, what my resume needed, how to approach something better, but also just really reaffirm my confidence, experience and accomplishments as a professional.

I would also prioritize opportunities that are lateral to your recent roles/levels where you are going to meet/exceed preferred qualifications, and those that are local to you. Many companies have tightened up when it comes to relocation (and remote is almost non-viable at this point), and with how competitive the market is you have to anticipate that any decent company is going to have 100+ applicants but will only interview the top 10-15, so you need to be above most of the qualifications listed to land in that elite category.

Depression,Author,Area 23 (FCB Health) 1,10 months,"Tax manager 1 said it very well. I am in a similar boat. My early life was corrupted by terrible decisions. At 30 I tried to get it together and invested my time into a partner for 7 1/2 years who died before we could have kids. I’m in a wonderful, loving relationship with someone who does not want more kids. This weighs on me. However one thing I’ve learned in my four decades on this earth is that jealousy is a delusion. Everyone of us sees the world 100% through the filter of our own unique experiences. It is impossible to fully understand what another persons life is like. When we are jealous, we simply superimpose one aspect of their life onto our life and pretend that that’s their life.",4,9/21/24 11:00,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/reflecting-on-life-as-i-see-friends-getting-married-having-kids-and-finding-their-own-places-at-30-my-journey-is-unique-and-i,1,223,4350

Depression,Other,an Associate 1,a year,"I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time. It must have been incredibly challenging to receive that news while already dealing with depression and stress. First and foremost, please remember that your worth is not defined by your job, and setbacks like this don't diminish your capabilities. It's important to prioritize your mental health right now.

Consider discussing your situation with your therapist or counselor to help you navigate this added stressor. Additionally, reach out to friends and family for emotional support. When you're ready, start exploring new job opportunities that align with your skills and interests. Update your resume and reach out to your network for potential leads.

Taking small steps towards your job search and focusing on self-care can make a big difference. Remember, setbacks happen to everyone, and with time and support, you can rebuild your self-esteem and find a new path that brings fulfillment and happiness. You're not alone in this journey, and there are people who care about your well-being.",1,9/21/24 11:02,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/going-through-depression-and-stress-i-was-recently-told-i-have-to-find-a-new-job-by-the-end-of-the-year-ive-been-working-extremely,1,227,4387

Feel free to DM if you want to chat more.

Taking care of you and your health is priority #1. Can’t work/help/advance if you’re incapacitated or need an admittance.

You’ve done great for yourself with the hand you were dealt and it sounds like it’s time to take some well-deserved rest.

Pros are pretty numerous and I think it’s well worth it to take the break.

Cons are that you might not get to roll back on to that project when you come back, unless it’s pretty long term. You can talk with the partner about that possibility.

No one needs to know (and it’s none of their business) why you need the break. Talk with your doctor about what you’d like to do and if they’d be willing to write you an excuse for it.

Talk to your partner about needing time off for health reasons and keep it at that. Then reach out to HR and ask what the process is for take a leave of absence.

You gotta prioritize your health (sleep, sleep, sleep) to prevent further damage.

It’s really easy to underestimate how much work a case is going to take, so then you can end up basically losing money if you don’t charge enough in your flat fee. You also have to know how much of the fee to refund, based on the work you’ve done, if they sub you out for another lawyer.

Clients also sometimes don’t want to pay the appropriate flat fee for a case because they don’t see how it’s connected to the work the case requires. All they hear is the number and can get sticker shock.

Depression,Other,a Counselor 1,7 months,Depending on where you are in your treatment it may be necessary to reevaluate and adjust your medications monthly. If you have been stable for several months or more and there is no revaluations or adjustments happening then treatment wise there is no reason to see you every month. There is a possibility that your insurance might demand monthly visits which you can find out from them directly. Most insurances push towards 90 day scripts so if they have not contacted you about this it could be very likely the reason. Otherwise yes it could absolutely be done intentionally by the provider to ensure monthly billing bc they do not get paid as much for refills as they do for visits.,4,9/21/24 11:05,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/for-anyone-thats-on-meds-for-depression-and-anxiety-it-is-typical-for-your-psych-to-require-a-visit-each-time-a-refill-is-needed,1,234,4449

You'd be surprised how various regular drugs can cause psychological reactions, and how often drugs rxed for psych reasons can cause physical reactions.

My psych Dr has educated me over the years about this. I saw him monthly at first, then gradually longer. Now I'm typically on a 6-month schedule.

My dxs are not complex, but I'm on meds for a lot of stuff (non psych meds). I try to run everything by my psych or at least ask the prescribing Dr about effects. One Dr gave me a new medication that made me suicidal for weeks - just one dose. My psych said it never should have been rxed to me, knowing I am treated for depression.

Depression,Other,a Transcriptionist 1,8 months,"Seriously, you need to address that driving phobia before you take another step. Sign up for a Drivers Ed course even if you took one 10 years ago. Start over. Forget what you know, or think you know, about driving right now and let the instructor believe you are a first-timer. From then on, it's just practice. Drive around the streets in your neighborhood, or find a country road where there's little traffic. You're already handicapped by this issue, having to turn down job possibilities because there's nobody to take you back and forth. I took public transit to work for 30+ years. I had my own car but wasn't willing to pay $60 or more per month for parking at work. If you find a job that ends too late at night for the bus, take the bus to work and an Uber to get home. You can't be relying on people to get you around. But tackle that driving phobia first. You can get over it with a proper driver training course and plenty of practice.","6

Depression,Author,Authora Change Manager,8 months,"Definitely know you’re not alone and don’t let it stop you from doing things you like.

I would recommend lowering alcohol consumption (assuming you drink) and starting therapy.

It’s important to remover that certain levels of anxiety are okay when warranted (presentations, deadlines, stressful events). It shouldn’t consume you, but it’s there so you take things seriously.

Another thing that helped me was becoming self aware when I was getting stuck in my head. It’s like getting stuck in this loop of wondering if I’m okay and trying to figure out what’s wrong. When I came back into the present, I would find my anxiety would drop.","2

Depression,Author,Authora Change Manager,8 months,"Thank you ❤️

Some tips that helped me

1. Nutrition- eating more greens and berries. I personally drink a lot of smoothies.

2. Getting enough sleep

3. Cutting back on booze

4. Making time to see friends and socialize. If you don’t have many, try to make some. Isolation only makes anxiety worse.

5. Don’t let anxiety stop you from traveling/taking vacations. Air travel makes me anxious, but I push through and do it anyway, it’s always worth the temporary discomfort.

Depression,Other,Progressive Insurance 1,8 months,Working consistently with a therapist and psychiatrist has done wonders for me.

Depression,Other,a Senior Director of Marketing 1,8 months,"I’d highly encourage you to start exercising. Being a person myself who struggles with what you’re going through along with ADHD I’ve made it a personal goal to walk minimum of 3 miles a day, eliminate coffee or any caffeine for alternatives such as mushroom coffee and cut out as much screen time as possible an hour before bed. If you can be OCD about this you’ll notice a difference. Good sleep can change your life, and in some cases substantially minimize the stress you’re encountering.

I have been looking into this and it’s also helped me better cope with negative mentalities - https://www.positiveintelligence.com/program/. I am baffled of all the therapy this has never been suggested, it’s been one of the greatest insights in the last few months for me.

You are more than enough, stay encouraged we are our worst critics. Remember you are not your thoughts, they are just popping up because of deep programming from years of bad habits and / or trauma. A lot of programming has to be undone and a lot of self-forgiveness too. It’s sad for me to see how the society we live in is so connected but so disconnected in almost every other way. The common theme, less tech more outdoors, more natural eating where at all possible.

I’d suggest finding jobs and work that can minimize your financial stress as an immediate fix while you look. You’ll appreciate it when it puts you in a new frame of mind and make sure you’re building new relationships not online but offline!

Best of luck to you. All of the above will help you navigate the highs / lows of applying.",,9/21/24 11:07,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/so-i-have-severe-anxiety-and-major-depression-disorder-and-its-hard-for-me-to-find-a-job-and-keep-one-what-would-be-some,1,237,4482

Work towards a goal step by step and establish a routine with your physical and mental health, make yourself follow these like a Robot first and once the Robot is ready, it will help you be much stronger. Mental Health is a huge business all over the world, if we push ourselves into depression, we definitely have the ability come out of it. Be ruthless with yourself to pick yourselves up.

Depression,Other,an Auto Claims Adjuster 1,4 months,"No, only if the reasoning for you being out of work is not related to your FMLA. So for example your FMLA is for anxiety which your dr approves but you take off to take your pet to the vet and use FMLA for that, or you go over your allowed time and do not recertify with your dr and the Ins co who is handling your claim.

Just make sure you explain to your doctor whats going on, and whats affecting you. Be open and honest and let them know about things going on at work. That way they’ll get an understanding of what you need and how much time you will need off. Remember to follow up with your representative that is handling your FMLA and always report your absences to HR. You don’t have to go into detail of why you’re taking an absence.

Depression,Other,an Associate 2,3 months,"Technically, it is illegal for an employer to fire you because you took FMLA. That would be unlawful retaliation.

Smart/savy employers would not, but shadier, stupid, ignorant or more cut throat employers might. If you are at a large employer I would not worry about it. If you are at a smaller company, maybe take into account what you know about the people making the termination decisions. Ultimately, if you really need the leave, then I’d say take it.

Unfortunately, mental health issues are not easily detectable. There is no blood test that can say no you are fine. Hospitals are full of people who keep going to doctors thunking they have something but tests confirm they are fine.

Depression,Other,a Senior Consultant 1,a year,"For me, the major changes have been around getting a job with more flexible timing of responsibilities, and flexible/self-driven scheduling when possible. I've managed these in my current career, though it's not the best career for these needs

I'm also working on a major career change. I'm currently in corporate consulting. It's useful because the rules are explicit but not useful because the demands are variable, it's hard to maintain routine, it's hard to maintain working relationships since they shift in the short term, and I personally don't get joy out of many aspects of the work.

I'm considering moving into academia, where the scheduling constraints are familiar and consistent, a network of collaborators exists already, I can work on passion work day in and day out, and meet ""coworkers"" based on that interest so relationships are more genuine. The demand on time and effort is known, but it is a kind of choose your own adventure type of field. This would fit me and my background better as well. And I would get to dress the way I like to and I wouldnt have to hide as much of my personality as client work requires

Until I make that change, I imagine my depression will continue to make it hard for me to motivate myself at work, no matter how many informal accommodations and treatment options I explore","2

Depression,Other,a SVP 1,a year,"I would say sit down (if you haven’t already) and build a list of all the companies you want to go after. Figure out the personas you need to connect with. Cross reference this against LinkedIn to see who you have mutual connections with (or not) and then reach out directly to contacts with a strong elevator pitch about your skills, or to ask for an intro, or to present yourself. The key is in messaging, you don’t want to come across pushy, salesy or desperate. You need to come across as human, grounded and confident in the value you can deliver. People on LinkedIn get bombarded with generic messages all the time. Obviously a lot will not respond, but keep shaking the tree this way and apples will start falling out. It takes time but in my opinion way more effective from my own experiences than blind applications. I’ve done this at all levels of my career. I’ve worked for 25 years and not once actually applied for a job. PS include headhunters and recruiters in your list. Ping me if you need help, even with how to position yourself. Glad to help.","1

Depression,Author,a Strategic Account Executive 1,a year,"While applying via a company's career site is traditional, it's not a great way of standing out. I'd take the time to identify the companies/job descriptions that are a good fit for your skills, career, etc. and then reach out to people on LinkedIn Directly. If you can't get any traction, start reaching out to recruiters of that organization. Lastly, visit the company's LinkedIn page and see if you can find any new hires. Reach out to them and see how they got in and if they could refer you, either by submitting your resume or by giving you the name of someone for you to contact.

Depression,Other,a Principal 1,2 months,"I think you are coming to it from the right perspective, but sometimes our mental chemistry is off. That is why doing a combined process works. Ideally, you see your therapist every week and your psychiatrist every 6-9 weeks; however, they communicate and help mitigate certain items that cannot be treated with only one side

An example from my perspective is that I have PTSD and Generalized Anxiety (with depressive tendencies), my therapist talks to me every week, but my psychiatrist is communicating and whenever my therapist thinks I might be going to the edge due to A, B, C; they reach out and adjust what I am taking (it can be temporary due to an emergency or more definitive; however, mental chemistry is a super complex science and we should allow for all the help we need)

Depression,Other,a Consultant 1,2 months,"I am a clinician and thought I’d add that perspective. The success of therapy is, as has been allude to, complex. Much has to do with where you are in your journey. That is your ability/desire to really know yourself and the internal/external environments you have/do experience/live in/through. This can be very challenging work and so there is a need to have a strong, trusting relationship with your therapist. To feel confident you are heard and understood and that you are hearing and understanding. Like any relationship these are works in progress as both of you must be equally vested in it. Depending on the suspected causation of you “symptoms”, e.g., depression takes more than three months of brief 50-ish minute once a week sessions to decode. So…unless you’re dealing with a total disconnect I recommend staying the course. Healing takes time. Humans are deeply complex, sensitive animals that live in an ever more complex, confusing world. A stable, consistent relationship with a therapist you feel safe with is the best way to discovering your path to health. On the topic of medications, they have their place and can be a helping hand but working toward understanding yourself and the amazingly unique and delightful creature you are is life long and with few if any unforeseen side effects. Hope this was helpful.","3

When my friends are going through a particularly bad depression spell I text them daily with their “daily check in” they have to respond with something could be as simple as “I’m still here” to them describing what they are feeling in detail. I respond accordingly. If it is an”I’m still here” response I do not pry, but let them know that I was thinking of them and was there if they wanted to talk. Sometimes I ask if they wanted to talk but not always. Having gone through depression myself it really makes a world of difference just knowing that there’s someone who cares. The daily check in became a familiar routine that brought me light when I couldn’t see it myself.

Being a support for someone with depression you have to know your own limits too. If you fill their half full cup from your half full cup where does that leave you? There were days when I would send my check in text respond then have to take some time for me. But eventually when I was feeling better later in the day I would always send a follow up.",4,9/21/24 11:18,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/what-is-the-best-way-to-handle-the-close-family-member-with-depression-should-i-just-ignore-that-and-hoping-he-would-feel-bettershould,1,262,4741

How do you support someone who never responds to you? I have a family member who fits the depressed description but anytime I reach out I don’t get a response.

Depression,Other,an Associate 1,a month,"Yes. You only need to tell your firm it’s for a “medical condition.” If they ask for impairments, you can say “cognitive issues and sleep difficulties” or something else generic. The PCP signing any paperwork is advisable because it doesn’t reveal the nature of your illness.

Also get checked for physical issues like sleep apnea and autoimmune issues. Several issues may be happening at the same time.

Make sure you’re eligible for FMLA as well (based on your tenure with the firm, # of employees). The employee handbook should describe procedures and who is the FMLA POC.

Depression,Other,a Lawyer 1,15d,"Take leave sooner rather than later. I fell into a pretty bad funk as a relative declined with terminal illness, which was hard by itself but also resurfaced depressive tendencies, and things at work would have been smoother if I had taken leave sooner.

Your benefits department will be able to tell you the FMLA application process. Don't tell them more than you need to - it's none of their business.

For depression (my experience, anyway) - prioritizing sleep first, followed by exercise, helps the most.

Also behavioral activation. Depression is perverse because it makes you want to stop going about life, but going on with life is often the best thing to keep your mood up. Find something - anything, as long as it's not obviously just to numb out feeling - that you can do, and do it. I started with making the bed when I woke up, then added some self-care things, then regular plans with friends, even if I felt crummy. It made a big difference.

Depression,Other,a Specialist 1,a year,"""How To Be Miserable: 40 Strategies You Already Use"" by Randy Paterson.

The gimmick is that it's telling you what not to do - humorously posed as helping you make yourself more miserable, as people with depression are wont to do - instead of yet another list of things you must be doing. This is based on the author's experience running a depression support group early in his career. It was easier to get them to talk about behaviors in these terms.

I found the reframing helpful. It's daunting trying to build healthy constructive behaviors from scratch. It was an easier sell to recognize shitty coping methods and cut them out, even if the outcome is still building positive habits.

The book inspired a video by the YouTuber CGP Grey that is an excellent distillation of some key points: https://youtu.be/LO1mTELoj6o",,9/21/24 11:19,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/what-is-the-bestmost-effective-book-or-podcast-that-you-would-recommend-that-improved-your-depressionanxiety-and-why,1,266,4782

It's very flexible and I can choose my own hours. This jo doesn't feed my soul but it pays well. So that is a reward in and of itself.

Depression,Other,,5 months,"Telling someone who is chronically ill and depressed to change their diet and think positive is so demeaning and the actual antithesis of being helpful. If it were that easy, none of us would be suffering. Trust me, I know from experience.
First of all- get into a good support group with people who actually understand and can provide empathy and constructive guidance. To be honest, however, sometimes there just isn't much guidance in terms of navigating the workforce or everyday life with these issues. Unfortunately, even in 2024 our society has yet to tackle these issues, and that is one reason behind the high uptick of poverty, houselessness, and worsening MH issues. It's a spiral and so many get caught in it because, after all- you don't *look* sick, so you just need a healthier diet and to make your bed in the morning.
I understand most are genuinely ignorant and are just trying to help. But when someone experiences the sane answers for decades, without any *real* help and improvement, well, they can get a tad cynical. It's scary to lose hope for how you can survive the rest of your life without being able to depend on these basics that many people don't realize aren't in our tool house. But what I will say is that there is *always* hope, you just need to look in the right places. Look outside the box, and create a life that works for you and can eventually help you be productive again. Once you can get to that step, you will feel swells of motivation coming back. It isn't easy, some days will feel like defeat, but you can do it, little by little. Listen to your body, and reach out to anything and anyone that inspires you. Find like minded people on social media platforms that can guide you with their own stories. And for goodness sake- don't settle for any job or health practitioner that doesn't listen to, respect, or advocate for you and your VALID needs. 🫂",6,9/21/24 11:20,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/due-to-health-issues-i-have-lost-a-bunch-of-jobs-i-have-ulcerative-colitis-depression-anxiety-ptsd-and-insomnia-my-physical,1,269,4800

If that is all you have the strength for, then at least you will have the dishes done and not piling up for 4 days and then looking like an impossible task. The other housework chores can be split up and done one or two chores each day. Call the social service agencies in your city and find out if any organization offers volunteer help for housework. In my city there is free help with housecleaning, yard maintenance, dog walking, and other things that seniors or chronically ill people have trouble doing themselves. The really important thing is to see your doctor regularly and make sure you are taking any medications regularly.

Depression,Other,a Vice President 1,4 months,"Penalties for a psychologist making a diagnosis after only one hour without sufficient information can vary depending on the jurisdiction, the specific circumstances, and whether the behavior is reported and investigated. Potential penalties can include:

1. **Professional Sanctions**: The psychologist may face disciplinary action from their state licensing board, which could include suspension or revocation of their license, fines, mandatory supervision, or required additional training.

2. **Ethics Violations**: The APA can impose sanctions on its members for violating ethical guidelines, which could range from a reprimand to expulsion from the association.

3. **Legal Consequences**: If the premature diagnosis leads to harm, the psychologist could face civil lawsuits for malpractice. This could result in financial compensation to the patient and potentially damage the psychologist's professional reputation.

4. **Employment Consequences**: The psychologist's employer might take action, which could include termination of employment.

These actions are based on the ethical standards outlined in the APA's Ethics Code, particularly under sections concerning competence and the necessity of sufficient information before making professional judgments.

For more specific information, you might refer to the [APA Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct](https://www.apa.org/ethics/code) and contact your local state licensing board.",,9/21/24 11:23,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/ive-worked-with-two-therapists-and-a-psychiatrist-the-therapists-i-worked-with-for-3-months-and-4-months-the-psych-i-saw-for,6,274,4849

Depression,Other,a Vice President 1,4 months,I'm married to a psychologist. That is 100% accurate. It's bonkers that you think a licensed therapist can have a diagnosis of bipolar disorder in 1 hour. You are beyond delusional. You will find ZERO articles or professional links to support your claim. I've already linked to the relevant APA section.,,9/21/24 11:23,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/ive-worked-with-two-therapists-and-a-psychiatrist-the-therapists-i-worked-with-for-3-months-and-4-months-the-psych-i-saw-for,9,274,4852
Depression,Other,a Vice President 1,4 months,"Diagnosing bipolar disorder involves a comprehensive assessment by a licensed mental health professional, often following specific guidelines and using established diagnostic tools. Here are the steps typically involved:

1. **Clinical Interview**: The clinician conducts a thorough interview to gather information about the patient's history, symptoms, and overall functioning. This includes exploring mood changes, energy levels, behavior, sleep patterns, and any psychotic symptoms.

2. **Medical History**: The clinician reviews the patient's medical history to rule out any physical conditions that could be causing the symptoms. This may include a physical examination and lab tests.

3. **Family History**: Since bipolar disorder can have a genetic component, understanding the family history of mental health issues can be crucial.

4. **Standardized Diagnostic Tools**: The clinician may use standardized questionnaires and rating scales such as:
- **Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ)**: A screening tool that helps identify the presence of bipolar disorder symptoms.
- **Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)**: Measures the severity of manic episodes.
- **Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS)**: Assesses the severity of depressive symptoms.

5. **DSM-5 Criteria**: The diagnosis is confirmed using the criteria outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). For bipolar disorder, this includes:
- **Bipolar I Disorder**: Characterized by one or more manic episodes, possibly accompanied by major depressive episodes.
- **Bipolar II Disorder**: Characterized by one or more major depressive episodes and at least one hypomanic episode.
- **Cyclothymic Disorder**: Chronic fluctuating mood disturbance involving numerous periods of hypomanic symptoms and depressive symptoms that do not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode.

6. **Differential Diagnosis**: The clinician rules out other potential causes for the symptoms, such as other psychiatric disorders (e.g., major depressive disorder, schizophrenia), substance abuse, or medical conditions.

- The substance use led to you committing and being convicted of a crime or something like that, but even then the employer would only see the conviction not any medical background.
- You were using illegal substances and this has showed up on drug tests.
- You are applying for a government security clearance, some of which do look into medical records. But this does not apply to the vast majority of jobs out there.","1

Depression,Other,Authoran Associate,9 months,"I have been in therapy since I was 16 (30 now). I have both diagnosed OCD, ADHD/ASD, and Depression. I have been on Prozac for 14 years with stings of non-medicated months.

OCD is considerably easier to keep in check with higher dosages of SSRIs. View medication as a means to lower the “baseline” level of symptoms. There will still need to be skills learned to compensate for the rest - that is where CBT and DBT come in to play. If you wish to not take medicine then I would explore those options first. Just know, I am not aware of anyone truly OCD that has had luck with just those.

Depression,Author,Authoran Associate,9 months,"Thank you so much for sharing your experience. I’ve tried an SSRI and a tricyclic and had intolerable adverse responses to both. I’m also concerned about the long term side effects even if another SSRI is more tolerable.

ERP (plus CBT and some DBT skills) have been working so far, albeit slowly, to improve both OCD and depression. My OCD specialist reports that not all patients benefit from medication. So I am curious if others also found a non-medication route to health and what that looks like. (I’m of course working with a psychiatrist.)","2

Depression,Other,a Vice President 1,4 months,"In my experience as a manager it was like a medical leave. The manager is not part of it and it’s not scheduled. You get a doc who will certify the need for leave and you call HR and tell them you are on leave or will be on leave the following week (not far off).
They tell the disability insurance provider that your requested leave and that provider reaches out to to the doc to verify. If it’s verified you get told how long and get paid whatever percentage is part of your benefits plan. Privacy is paramount so HR does not speak to the doc or even know what the condition. Neither does your manager.

You can’t plan it bc the insurance will only cover something emergent or like a planned surgery. They won’t pay if the doc is like “OP needs
3 weeks off next quarter bc they will be hurting then.” Maybe your doc would be willing to agree to sign the stuff in a few weeks and YOU can know you will be out, but HR and your manager will not until you are on leave. Sometimes people work the few days the paperwork is happening bc they can’t risk the unpaid days. But typically it’s a planned medical procedure or a “starting now” situation. If denied some people then return to work or take PTO.",,9/21/24 11:32,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/im-looking-into-mental-health-leave-at-work-and-am-wondering-if-anyone-could-provide-insight-on-a-few-things-1-can-you-schedule,1,295,5047

Another option is to go on long term disability leave, if you have that option through Principal or a long term disability leave/income protection carrier.

Depression,Other,Genmedicus health (unverified) 1,6 months,"I hold a PhD in life sciences, and I wanted to offer some advice.

First, take the time to explore your research interests within your field. Identify areas that spark your passion and align with your career goals. When you find an area your passionate about it won’t feel like work so much. I encourage you to reach out to current PhD students in similar programs and gain insights into their experiences, challenges, and rewards. Their perspectives can provide valuable insights as you contemplate this academic journey.

When evaluating programs, consider factors besides costs, such as faculty expertise, research facilities, funding opportunities, and program structure. Look for programs that offer funding or stipends to alleviate financial burdens during your studies.

Networking is essential in academia. Attend conferences, seminars, and networking events to connect with researchers in your field of interest. Don’t be surprised if some will ghost you, the others can lead to collaborations, mentorship, and future career opportunities. If you connect, don’t ignore them. Stay in touch, even if it’s just to say hello.

You mentioned your past challenges, and I suggest maintaining a healthy work-life balance, even a few hours a week of “me time” is crucial during your PhD studies. Don’t ignore your hobbies, things you like and enjoy doing to prevent burnout.
And lastly, stay flexible if you find your interests and career plans evolve as you have new experiences and insights during your PhD studies, adjust to accommodate them. Success is a moving target!

Wish you lots of success.",,9/21/24 11:40,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/im-25-been-moving-from-job-to-job-hoping-to-find-a-job-where-i-can-actually-learn-the-science-behind-the-work-i-do-ive-worked-in,1,313,5169

Depression,Other,a Postdoctoral Fellow 1,6 months,"25 is definitely not too late.

Regarding mental health, I can say that doing a PhD can be very mentally stressful. I myself suffered from panic attacks during my PhD and know friends who developed clinical depression. However, rather than let that stop you from pursuing a PhD, I agree with the other comments that you should just be very aware of that when going into a PhD program. Make sure you have a good support network of friends/family and take care of your mental health. Use resources offered by the school when you can, like counseling or career groups. You might also want to choose a program that allows you to graduate early with a Master's (just to have a back-up plan in case things really don't work out).

Overall, I think your industry experience will also help with navigating the PhD, so I'd say just go for it!",,9/21/24 11:40,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/im-25-been-moving-from-job-to-job-hoping-to-find-a-job-where-i-can-actually-learn-the-science-behind-the-work-i-do-ive-worked-in,1,313,5171

You will fail. You will get rejected. It’s important to build that resilience and know how to compartmentalize these challenges. Joining communities of other entrepreneurs or startup founders on Slack or meetup can be cathartic to be around people who go through same challenges.

It’s a journey of growth and look at it as that. My upbringing low-self-confidence, perfectionism and being overly critical of myself made it so hard when I was younger and was a crutch.

my workplace gave me a medical leave, I paused my dogwalking and petsitting routine as well,

And it’s not even a lack of money that bothers me, it’s just that I don’t have my money in my own hand. People borrowed money from me and never gave it back since may, I’m not getting my work paychecks, not cleared to work until January, and I’m not really supposed to take this kind of stress during recovery

By the time it’s six weeks post surgery I will be fine but I need to throw these thoughts here so that they don’t get bottled up, I even made emergency fundraisers just in case so I’m not really worried about losing a house or anything else

I’m just depressed, even though I have no reason to be because everything will be okay and it’s my new life I will start after this first flash of pain; and I’ll look good while getting back to work, since top surgery I haven’t felt any stress about how I look and it’s very freeing and a wonderful silver lining,

￼ if anyone reads through this, thank you for hearing me out,

Depression,Other,a Senior Consultant 1,10 months,"Personally (grain of salt, I am just a person), I would only have an accommodation request on file if you need it. not health information

Health information is not enough. Knowing what issue you have doesn't tell them how it impacts work and what protocol to follow in the event that you have a flare up. And these things vary by the person, not by the condition so much.

And, when you write an accommodation request in that format (impact, protocol) you don't need to add any specifics about the condition you face. You would just preface by saying ""I have a chronic health condition that can flare up. When those flare ups happen, I will need to _______ (call out of work unexpectedly? ____ for up to x amount of hours/days at a time. I will notify as soon as possible when the flare up begins. I will partner closely with x person to get any work in progress covered.""

Or maybe you have routine medical appointments that you can't miss or reschedule, that's a good one to note down.

Depression,Other,a Transcriptionist 1,10 months,"I would not tell HR anything. You don't know if it can come back at you in a bad way. There are still a lot of people who attach an incorrect stigma to mental illness - they assume you are a weakling trying to use any excuse to get special accommodations at work, or that you are admitting that you're not able to handle the job any longer. Give the meds and therapy some time to start working fully and see if those are going to make the difference. While you're doing that, get some books on Mindfulness and start to teach yourself how to calm yourself and get your focus back. There are some very good books out there, some of them come with workbooks that you actually work your way through like a course in school.

Great stress, sadness, and anxiety resulted in coughing fits, which progressed over months to an inability to inhale for scary periods of time. I don't know what you should do with your employer. I suppose it depends on safety for yourself or those around you. But what I did to beat my mental health issue was to identify the sources and triggers of my sadness. It was the sad things I allowed myself to dwell on throughout my downtime. And one trigger for it was the sad or angry music that I was addicted to. My dad brought it to my attention, that I could choose what I allow myself to dwell on. And at some point, dwelling on negative things become unhelpful or unproductive and it only serves to hurt. So, I drastically regulated my music selection. And the other thing I do now is, I have a private and very honest prayer journal. I write to God about the things that are weighing on me and I seek His counsel. I still have sad thoughts like anyone else, but I no longer allow myself to Dwell on them outside of my prayer time.

The offer only stated that the position was contingent on a background check and drug screen. There was no mention of any standards regarding mental or physical health. I'm a job applicant. Unless I'm applying for a position in employment law or human resources, it seems unreasonable to expect a random applicant to know all laws and regulations for any position they may apply to. It's like if a job post says a high school diploma is the only education required, then telling someone that they should have a masters after they've accepted the job offer and gone to orientation.",,9/21/24 11:58,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/has-anyone-ever-been-offered-a-job-went-to-orientation-and-was-then-denied-hours-or-a-transfer-to-another-less-stressful-position,8,356,5428
Depression,Other,an Assistant Product Manager 1,a year,"I have a strong sense that they didn't spring it up. Check documents. Not sure which state you're in to assist.

But now it makes sense.

You were not made an offer. This is called a ""conditional"" offer.

I can sign a contract, not pass the background check, and not be considered hired.

It's not your job to know the laws, it's your job to disclose information during eval.

It seems they're evaluating next steps.

Good luck","2

Depression,Author,,a year,"The ""conditional"" offer should have mentioned 3 conditions in that case, not just 2. Additionally, they've been ""evaluating next steps"" since June 13th. It's now almost Halloween, and multiple applications to other positions that the HR representative stated would not be considering any physical have either been refused or simply ignored. The only thing of any substance I've gotten is multiple letters about deductions not being taken from my paycheck, which makes sense since I'm not getting one. So I'm still on the payroll, I still have active health insurance (which I haven't used, aside from one trip to the ER in July for chest pain), but I'm not being allowed to work in either the position I was hired for or in another role where my mental health history doesn't matter.

Depression,Other,a Transcriptionist 1,a year,"It's the act of arguing that is so degrading and fatiguing. There will always be issues in life - married or not - where viewpoints differ, needs differ, and a meeting of the minds is impossible. That's where communication style comes into play. There is nothing in life that needs to be ARGUED about - arguing is just two or more people involved in a single issue who are trying to strong-arm their way to ""winning"" - having the ending turn out in their favor. Rather, learn to discuss issues on a rational level without raised voices, threats, tears or walk-aways. Don't insist on ""winning"" and having to stress yourself to the max for that ""win"". Instead, learn to look at conflict issues as learning curves - maybe the other person's suggested solution really IS better for everyone. When we're raising children, we usually have set boundaries for a lot of issues so that when they arise, they are already decided. ""No, you can't go to your friend's house after supper to play video games on a school night. Those visits are saved for weekends."" ""If you want ice cream, you have to eat everything on your dinner plate first"". We usually start these ""rules"" when the kids are very young, and add or subtract boundaries as they get older. Maybe adults need to continue having pre-set boundaries on hot box issues so that there is no need to even let an argument begin. ""A friend has offered to sell you 6 of his NHL game tickets and you want to buy them?"" ""Our budget is written out and taped on the refrigerator door - the answer is there"". Negotiation may start at that point, but the basic premise is something that is already decided, so it becomes a discussion around what can be moved/changed in order to accommodate the request. That shouldn't result in a hair-tearing argument. If you find yourself questioning if you'd be better off single so you could avoid any potential conflict, then neither of you are respecting the pre-set boundaries that you both agreed on earlier.",,9/21/24 12:03,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/my-husband-and-i-generally-have-a-good-relationship-but-everytime-we-argue-i-feel-like-it-hits-me-harder-than-it-hits-him-once,1,366,5508

Depression,Other,a Licensed Professional Counselor 1,7 months,"Well it depends on what your motive is by claiming to be disabled. To claim to be disabled the condition you have must be one that “substantially limits one or more major life activities”. So your depression/anxiety must be so severe to the point that you’re unable to perform these major life activities. For example, if the condition were to prevent you from sleeping, prevent you from physically moving, or prevent you from having any form of communication with others, then you may claim to be disabled. There also needs to be a historical record of the condition being present and limiting the major life activities.

If you genuinely are disabled to the extent I mentioned above, the only reason you’d claim to be disabled would be to receive workplace accommodations due to the condition.

If what you’re experiencing doesn’t fit the criteria for being “disabled”, and/or you’re trying to use those psychological conditions to your advantage, that would be called Malingering, which is a big no-no.",1,9/21/24 12:03,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/is-it-counter-productive-to-say-that-i-have-a-disability-depressionanxietyetc-on-applications,1,368,5512

Depression,Other,a Licensed Professional Counselor 1,7 months,"If the severity is great enough, see a physician, establish a record of symptoms and experiences, and when you’re interviewing/hired for a new position and you claim a disability be prepared to discuss how the workplace can “reasonably accommodate” you and what you experience, so you don’t receive disciplinary action should the condition adversely impact your job performance.","1

Depression,Author,Authora Delivery Driver,7 months,"That's basically my reason for it, to make the employer aware that I may need to set up an accommodation. I was able to with a previous employer, but it turned out not getting enough. So now it's been 3 JOBS in a row I've lost because of poor attendance because of mental health. It's a horrible cycle of I can't hold a job long enough to afford the healthcare or qualify for health benefits so I can get the help I need.
I greatly appreciate you taking the time","2

Depression,Other,a Licensed Professional Counselor 1,7 months,"While you’re searching for work, apply for Medicaid. Should you be approved, you’ll be able to get mental healthcare covered in full. Once you are approved for Medicaid, you’ll have that coverage for minimum 1 calendar year from when you’re approved. Regardless if you get a job and employer healthcare benefits, you’ll still remain covered for that year. If you do get employer benefits, the Medicaid will convert to a secondary insurance and cover what your private insurance doesn’t. When you can do that, get in to see a doctor, establish your psychological/medical history, you’ll be able to claim disability status. As a result, an employer would have an extremely difficult time being able to legally fire/let you go, should your condition negatively impact your job performance. With an established disability, they cannot discriminate against you because of the disability. So, if the disability impacts your performance, they really can’t fire you because of it. They would legally have to provide reasonable accommodation for the disability. This could include allowing “mental health leave” should your symptoms become severe enough. Sure, they could withhold pay since you wouldn’t be working while on leave, just like they would if you went on medical leave or required a personal leave for some reason. But, it would ensure you still have a job once the leave is over.

The general rule of thumb is that any accommodations must be reasonable and not cause “undue burden” on the employer. For example, if a disability requires the employer to spend $1,000,000 to accommodate an employee, they can legally deny the accommodation and choose to not hire them, and that would not be considered as discriminating against the person because it would cause “undue burden”, in this case financial burden. Or, say someone with no arms applies for a job as a butcher. The deli can decline to hire them because they can’t reasonably accommodate that type of disability and continue to be in business.

Had you had an established history of your condition, your previous employers could have been held liable for firing you since your performance was due to a disability as opposed to poor work ethic or laziness.","4

But I don’t know if I can handle the mental stress right now as I am constantly in flight and self doubt mode definitely not a growth mindset. Part of me feel maybe I should just move on and get another job better suited for me essentially back to my comfort zone.,"2

Depression,Author,a Director 1,8 months,Get a letter from your psychiatrist for the ESA and then present it to your landlord and ask if they want an extra pet deposit. Don't overthink it.,,9/21/24 12:07,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/suffered-from-anxiety-and-depression-for-a-long-time-i-was-on-an-ssri-for-a-couple-years-and-recently-came-off-them-i-do-not,1,377,5563
Depression,Author,Accenture 1,8 months,"Look up your state’s rules but typically ESAs legally cannot be denied even if the building has stipulations against pets. They also cannot charge you pet rent. Some landlords really do not like this and might argue, however, if you have a letter from your psychiatrist, that is legally effective (make sure to get this before bringing your pet home). It’s a lot easier to deal with if you choose a building that allows pets (and you can use ESA status to negate their pet “rent” charges, which are a scam to normal pet owners anyways).

One thing I will mention though, because not many do, is that young puppies can make depression worse for a time (google “puppy blues.”) This is mostly because of the sleep deprivation when you’re potty training them and the disruption to your daily life by the amount of 24/7 work it is at first, especially if they suffer from separation anxiety. However, if you can get through this stage (or if you adopt an adult dog), an ESA is absolutely worth it and you’ll reap so many benefits to your mental health. For me, my dog is truly a key part of treating my depression.",,9/21/24 12:07,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/suffered-from-anxiety-and-depression-for-a-long-time-i-was-on-an-ssri-for-a-couple-years-and-recently-came-off-them-i-do-not,1,377,5564

3. You can request reasonable accommodations, like your boss communicating with you only in writing, due to your medical diagnoses.

I agree with everyone’s responses so far.

Please do not depend on HR to document for you; you keep on with the documentation. Before you return to work (I’m assuming you are not back yet) obtain copies of all documentation you have.

I have anxiety and depression, never lost time over it, I thought, until many of my medical conditions also left me when I removed myself from a job I was at for 12 years and quite toxic.

Just this weekend, I did something completely out of my comfort zone and up and quit a position due to a few toxic employees. It was a great feeling after my brain told me that you can not feel bad for a company that allows toxic traits to walk in to the door every morning.

Since we don’t know why he was shitty to you; but was he like that with everyone? There is no need to tell us, as one person would tell you it’s not that bad, and someone else would tell you to sue boss and company.
Do you want to put yourself through that again? Maybe it’s time to change jobs and use your experience in looking for what you are passionate about and your experience from the past to determine what you are going to or not going to put up with.

For me, the risk was worth it. I don’t want to look back on my career in 30 years and wish I had more time to spend doing things I dream of doing in my career today.

Depression,Other,an Account Manager 1,8 months,"If quitting your job isn’t an option as it wouldn’t be for most, you should definitely find a therapist who you can talk to and maybe even get on medication. The first therapist and/or medication you try may not help much, but try not to let it discourage you from continuing to try talking with a different therapist or different medication. Every person is different, so just because something works well for some people, doesn’t mean it will work well for you.

Exercise is also a great option for improving your mental health. If you can talk a walk or do 30 minutes of strength training or even basic stretching or yoga at least 3-4 days a week, your mood will improve.

I would also let your supervisors or any higher up you feel comfortable speaking with know about how you’re feeling so maybe they can be patient and understanding of your current situation. Let them know you’re working on making it better, so it’s only temporary.

Cue volunteering somewhere you can get some experience in whatever field. I recently hired a young architect that is just finishing college. I met him when we were both volunteering. He was 17 at the time. I never forgot him. When we decided to build a house, I contacted him. He now has 4 contracts because of that.

Cue getting out of your own way. I figured out how to go to university at 43 as a single mom. (I also talked them into letting me into the MA program with only a single year of undergrad.) In a total of 3 years, I graduated with a 3.78 GPA while working full-time and running/owning a seasonal kiosk in a mall plus raising my daughter. It was tough.

You can do this. You just need to make a plan!

Depression,Other,a Customer Service Representative 1,3 months,"As a person with ptsd, this is a very difficult conversation. Ptsd patients like myself have a very hard time communicating and when we do, unfortunately for some, not all. it will become explosive rage. First thing, if and only if you are willing to continue for a love one. Is reassurance, reasure that they are safe, They are loved, and that everything is OK. Dont make them feel like a Burden by saying hey, I can't help you anymore. You need professional help. Unfortunately wen we are hurting it seems like we are being dismissed, or pushed off to another because we are that ""bad"". Abandonment, trust, loyalty, are always an issue. And most are not related to nor due to you at all. Just unfortunate experiences they had to suffer through that come back. No matter how hard you try to avoid thoughts negative thoughts, therapy, medicine does help but does NOT make it go away. And yes ptsd can be for life. 10 years with my partner and still going strong. If you truly love them, give them the best you can with constant love,reassurance, trust, and understanding. If you are being affected by this in a very negative way to your own mental health please be careful with announcing this to your partner because they will feel guilty very guilty. But make it clear that they need to work with you too, that a relationship is a two way street. And make it very clear that you aren't pushing them away. That you are not taking away from their own personal pain whatsoever. But expressing that you too are struggling to constantly see your partner (with ptsd) in pain and it's taking a big toll on you. And if they don't unfortunately it's best to give them ""space"" to clear their minds and seek help. They must try to understand you are human too, that you can develop residual effective as well. I'm sorry. I hope this makes sense and helps. best to you and your partner.

Pre-sobriety my anxiety and depression were super intense, but that was driven mostly by a weekly alcohol withdrawal cycle and the cumulative effect of the disease.

Early sobriety my anxiety and depression were related to my re-wiring brain, uncertainly about the program (and recovery in general), and an unavoidable tendency to “future trip”.

Now, with 5.5 years of sobriety, when I experience anxiety it’s because I’ve slipped back into future tripping and because I’m trying to control things that I can’t control. Basically, I’m not trusting my Higher Power with the results, so I feel I, in my infinite wisdom, need to step in.

Depression,Other,a Senior Manager 1,a month,"Mindfulness exercises really helped me. The Calm app is covered through my companies insurance and I use it in the morning and at the evening to talk me down.

ChatGPT has really helped. I use the voice to text feature to just kind of rant at it and it helps me get everything out. It’s actually been pretty helpful and helping me reframe my thinking around my anxieties as well. So if you don’t like therapist that might be a route to go, even though it technically keeps saying it’s not supposed to be used for it. ”hey ChatGPT, here’s what I am worried about today….” Then it usually says something nice but for a generic and then I ask it tell me figure out which one of my anxieties is actionable. And then I ask to come up with an action plan for the next day or week or several weeks. I don’t actually follow through with everything but it’s just really nice to get it out there and have a plan and I feel I’m not out here floating by myself with my problems.

3) process while on leave? I was hoping to go stay with my mom who lived abroad on leave, but i don’t know if that’s an option? I’m seeing online that you need regular checking with a medical professional through the leave?

Depression,Other,a Manager 1,4 months,"I’ve taken leave for an episode of major depression.

1. Do you have STD in your benefits plan? If so, initiate a claim with your provider. There will be paperwork for your doctor as part of the approval process. I saw my psychiatrist first before initiating the claim. Your insurance provider may have a requirement of taking a set amount of consecutive PTO before your leave starts. There should be guidance on all of this with your employer.
2. I stopped working immediately per my doctor’s instructions and filed the claim. Don’t worry about handoff. Not sure if that impacts your claim as it sounds like you could keep working, which reminds me of this news story. Totally different situation though. https://amp.miamiherald.com/news/state/florida/article284925187.html
3/4. Take as much time as you need. You work with your doctor for the return to work date. You can always change if you need. They probably have an idea of how much time someone in your position needs, but each case is different. I think I saw my doctor weekly which may have been policy but also I was in an abysmal state of mind.

Depression,Other,a Traveling Inventory Associate Driver 1,5 months,"First.. Take some time to do shadow work.. meaning face the mirror, self reflect, soul reflect, and forgive urself for all the trauma u were given but never deserved... Usually God will sit u down for periods of time so u can work on urself to elevate.. u must u this time of isolation to unlearn what society taught u what life was about in order to be considered successful... things like u have to have a big house, 2 cars, a high class job with an income of 5,000 a month, hit the gym to have a model body, and play sports at a Olympic level.. Use this time to find what brings u peace.. things that make u happy.. painting, drawing, writing, etc.. find things to do that does not require others people's involvement in order to do it.. what I mean when I say things that require other ppl involve, I'm talking about things like playing spades, playing football, Etc... The more u love on urself the more u will raise ur vibrations.. the more u will attract.. ur life is s reflection of the energy u put out in the universe.. Depression comes from Living in the Past.. Anxiety comes from Living in the Future.. but Peace.. Peace comes from Living in the Present.. Strive for peace of mind on a daily ok.. Take it one day at a time.. Honestly, we all only get 24hrs a day to do anything 🤷 that's it.. Tomorrow's NEVER Promised.. It's called the Present because it is a Gift that some ppl didn't get the opportunity to having 🫂 Stop being so hard on urself, due to listening to the negative opinions of others around u.. There opinions do not define who u are as a person.. it's a reflection of who they are.. it's up to u to make those opinions true.. understand that everyone's input about ur life are only just opinions; simple because they are not u.. U are doin a lot better in life than u think u are ok 🫂 The fact that u are able to express ur feelings truly is already doing better than what others aren't capable of.. the fact ur searching for help is already doing better than what others are capable of, due to the lack of Accountability.. Accountability/Acknowledgment/Acceptance are ALWAYS the first steps to Elevation and Growth.. One who lacks accountability due to Ego will NEVER elevate or grow.. A person cannot fix a problem in their life, if that person can't even see that problem to begin with.. U cannot ask for anything in the Universe u can't or are unwilling to give urself.. it all starts within ☯️ U can't ask for Honest Help.. If u arent capable of being Honest with urself first ✌️😎 U doing better than u think.. Ppl need to stop being so hard on themselves.. due to not being able to control Life 🤷 U can only control 10% of Life, which are ur emotions and reactions... The other 90% are out of ur control 💯💯💯 Life isn't a competition or race.. Life is a Journey of the Soul.. Not a Journey of the Vessel 🫡 There's a reason why no one can take Money and Status with them when they died 🤦 That's because that's not what's MOST Important and it's not what Life is about 💪🥷☯️ Sometimes all it takes is a shift of perspective.. Learn the Difference between CONSTRUCTIVE Criticism and DESTRUCTIVE Criticism 👍 Not everyone is trying to help u 🫡

When my mom asked me how therapy was helping me, I joked ‘it’s helping me understand a lot more about my childhood…’

Later I explained I do talk through my childhood a bit but because that’s when so many behavior patterns are set. My anxiety and depression are partially a result of that, but it’s not their fault. They did things that were actually good or neutral (much of based on how they grew up) and I internalized that stuff. Some of it went haywire due to my genes and personality. So exploring those childhood patterns helps me understand what sets me off and how I tick.

Depression,Other,an Investment Banking Analyst 1,2 months,"Honestly if depression is something that you’ve dealt with I would suggest going into another path. Clearly you’re very smart and entrepreneurial I would target something with strong WLB and solid pay. Going through the 5 year slog of IB/PE analyst/associate is brutal. You get a bad bounce in a sweat shop and if you weren’t depressed before you will be. So if that’s something that you’ve had before I would protect your help it isn’t worth it.

That being said considering you’re in Europe maybe hours are better and want to give it a go. I think most people are pretty accommodating if you said you had a family emergency (no need to go into details) and had to take care of someone. Your background and through networking should make it easy to get interviews at least. It’s a shitty thing to deal with but there will be jokers out there who will look down on you if you mention you were depressed etc so idk if that’s worth mentioning.

I’ve had to fight for myself, setting boundaries on my work hours, being clear with my manager and putting the work in to prove I need it. That has paid off, but it came with more work and a period of time knowing it’s still my job, I have to do these things until it changes.

I was kind of farmed and taken advantage of for 13 years (first 3 permatemp) because I didn’t know what I was other than high-performing. I never pushed for the salary others were making or even credit for all of my work. My employers both laid me off while on leave - COWARDS. I had to go on leave for exhaustion more than once. Employers do not always share our tendency toward loyalty. They are often aware of how to manipulate us. Try not to take it personally. It is not a shortcoming on our part. Just a different connection. If you are like me, you love the code. Some people like the money they make from our passions too.

Not all anyone, of course, but greed and exploitation seem a little more free and easy these days, unfortunately.

I’m sorry this happened to you. But nothing is *wrong* with you. We are all born perfect, with our own strengths and weaknesses. Nature decides. We just have to roll with the hand we are dealt.

I was diagnosed with ADHD in my 30s, and it looks like I went for the high score on self-tests for ASD just a few months back (nearly 20 years later - let’s say I missed some jokes over the years). We all had to adapt to things kids today are lucky to get help with (if they can even get in for diagnosis). A menagerie of coping mechanisms.
