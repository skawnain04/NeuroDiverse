Schizophrenia,Other,an Administrative 1,2 months,"Neither, don't confirm or deny, but validate some feelings if you can. It's hard for a trained professional to calmly talk someone out of a delusion, dont try it. It can make things much worse. On the flip side, you don't want to give in to it and have them believe what they are experiencing is real. It's a tough and fine line to support someone neutrally.

Get help for yourself on how to deal, and see if your mother is open to help while having moments of clarity. Schizophrenia doesn't get better but can be managed if someone is willing to medicate, and that is also a rough process because different medications work differently on different people. Then it has to be monitored, sometimes switched. Not to mention a lot of schizophrenics stop taking it when the medication does the job and they aren't having delusions because they feel they don't need it, then go back to a manic state.",,9/20/24 14:11,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/my-mother-was-diagnosed-with-schizophrenia-and-it-has-been-one-of-the-hardest-things-when-she-gets-psychotic-i-dont-know,1,1,1
Schizophrenia,Other,an Events Technology Manager 1,2 months,"Hot take: If the person is experiencing it, it's real. Usually, all the thoughts are about harmful or scary stuff.

I had an ex who literally used to see dead people like the Sixth Sense movie, usually when we were travelling. It would freak him out suddenly. As human beings, made in God's image, we technically have authority over the spirit world. For those who follow Jesus, there's specific protection/freedom available if it's exercised. All that is to say, I explained this to him, told him to tell the apperitions to go away and not return. He did and they didn't come back.",4,9/20/24 14:11,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/my-mother-was-diagnosed-with-schizophrenia-and-it-has-been-one-of-the-hardest-things-when-she-gets-psychotic-i-dont-know,1,1,2

Schizophrenia,Other,IBM 1,2 months,"My mom is in her early 70's, and has dementia. She seems ""with it"" at times, exacerbated by how relatively young she is, so in the beginning (pre-diagnosis) my wife and I drove ourselves crazy trying to correct mom in all of her ""lies,"" it was quite literally maddening. We both took it personally, as if Mom was intentionally trying to go against us.

As she has progressed in the disease, it becomes more and more obvious that Mom's not playing with iur emotions. The mom I grew up with isn't in there flr the most part. Once she was diagnosed, it all made so much more semse, and we began to have a muchn stronger empathy, and wholly stopped trying to fight her reality, knowing that she's not capable of acting on what she says, and that she truly sees a different reality than we do. I don't know about schizophrenia, but dementia patients literally do not comprehend that they are experiencing cognitive decline. There is no amount of reasoning that will change this, she can't be ""reprogrammed.""

We generally ignore or go along with whatever her narrative is. The most common example is the claim every single weekend that she is going to move back to her home state, buy a house, etc. Rather than telling her how dangerous that would be for her, I simply say ""ok Mom, just let me know when you've bought a plane ticket, so we'll know when you are leaving. This has been going on for almost 4 years now, and she hasn't so much as looked up airfare online.

I do understand that schizophrenia is a very different disease, so my experience may not be directly relatable, though I do think it's helpful to show how managing your own emotions and reactions is key to staying sane and somewhat detached. Don't expect your Mom to change or be able to think about your point of view.",,9/20/24 14:11,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/my-mother-was-diagnosed-with-schizophrenia-and-it-has-been-one-of-the-hardest-things-when-she-gets-psychotic-i-dont-know,1,1,18

Schizophrenia,Other,a RN Staff Nurse 1,9 months,Alot of facilities in my area have done away with the chair and bed alarms because of a loop hole that it doesn't prevent falls and could still be a restraint because the resident may not move to prevent setting it off so they aren't free to move...sounds like lawyer jargon to me. Also putting residents at the desk that don't want to be there is another issue as well.

Schizophrenia,Other,a Manager 1,10 months,"Hate to tell you this but schizophrenia also runs in families, and I don’t think can be tested for genetically.

Schizophrenia,Author,Authoran Accessibility Designer,10 months,"I had genetic testing done through my fertility clinic. I’m not sure exactly what was tested for (it was like 200 things) but that could be worth exploring. If you aren’t seeing a fertility specialist, then maybe your OB/GYN might have some leads about genetic specialists to see prior to trying to conceive.

Unfortunately, you cannot really ‘control’ genetics. Unless maybe there are tests you could do on an embryo before implantation with IVF but I’m not sure exactly what conditions they test for with those. Other than that it is just testing both partners to get a statistical probability.

Also know that autism is a spectrum. What is shown in film/media as autism is not the only way autism presents and it is not always so severe.",2,9/20/24 13:48,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/hello-i-wanted-to-ask-a-very-personal-question-which-i-need-to-communicate-with-my-husband-his-brothers-son-has-autism-and,1,4,56
Schizophrenia,Author,Authoran Accessibility Designer,10 months,"Yes my Nephew has Autism he is completely normal but never spoken a word and he is 6 years old . My husband sometimes gets emotional and it hurts to see him. It would really hurt us if we have one more child on the spectrum. I just want to try my best if we can avoid it. If not, that is god’s decision 🙂","1

Schizophrenia,Other,Bank of America 1,10 months,"What I am saying is that there are plenty of fully functioning adults on the autistic spectrum. Maybe come off a little socially awkward — but nothing so far as being non-verbal or other extremes.

Anyway, it seems like a genetic specialist would be your best bet. See if your local hospital has a way to search for departments or specialist on their website as a way to get started.","2
