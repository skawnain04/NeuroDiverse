Depression,a Software Engineer,San Diego State University,Tech,7 months,"I got laid off yesterday and was wondering if I had to work
Im responsible for 2 kids and need to quickly find a job within 45 days starting from today.
I had most stories taken away from my Mgr even before the notice period so I'm very demoralized now and was wondering I had to join meetings and continue to work?
I also was diagnosed with clinical depression due to being a toxic place for so long.
Do I still go in the office and work?
I need to prep and find a job now
