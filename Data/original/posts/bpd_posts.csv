BPD,an Associate,San Diego State University,Confession,a year,Ex-boyfriend has borderline personality disorder and he did a lot of hurtful and abusive things to me during the relationship. He refuses to maintain support to heal so I had to end it. I know I made the right choice but I feel really bad for him and bad about how the relationship ended. I know he made the choice to hurt me but because he has a disorder I really feel bad for him because I realize some of it can‚Äôt be helped. How do I get over this without reestablishing anything with him?,6,7,,2024-09-20 14:21:05,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/exa-boyfriend-has-borderline-personality-disorder-and-he-did-a-lot-of-hurtful-and-abusive-things-to-me-during-the-relationship-he,4
