OCD,a Managing Director 1,San Diego State University,Consulting,7 months,Is it weird to joke about being OCD at work? I did this and people began to think I was actually OCD.,6,32,,9/20/24 12:01,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/is-it-weird-to-joke-about-being-ocd-at-work-i-did-this-and-people-began-to-think-i-was-actually-ocd,1
OCD,a Manager,San Diego State University,Consulting,3 months,"Normally I'm not super sensitive but it bothers me how people misuse medical conditions as slurs or jokes, especially in the office. OCD is not a cutesy description. Bipolar is not a cutesy description. Alcoholic is not a cutesy description. These are real medical conditions and it is cruel and offensive to use them as slurs or jokes. If you don't go around calling people f*ggots and r*tards then don't go around calling people bipolar, OCD, or alcoholic who aren't.",11,26,2,9/20/24 12:02,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/normally-im-not-super-sensitive-but-it-bothers-me-how-people-misuse-medical-conditions-as-slurs-or-jokes-ocd-is-not-a-cutesy,2
OCD,a Manager,San Diego State University,Relationships,a month,Is it time to end things when you think of how your life would be easier if you were single? I feel like I’m wasting my life with an immature partner who can never take accountability & feels he is never wrong. Asking him to clean up after himself results in him telling me I “bring no value and am a slob” despite the fact that I do majority of domestic duties and cooking (we both work). The house is ocd clean & I food prep all our meals. I’m still attractive & don’t want to waste my youth,4,19,1,9/20/24 12:03,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/is-it-time-to-end-things-when-you-think-of-how-your-life-would-be-easier-if-you-were-single-i-feel-like-im-wasting-my-life-with,3

OCD,a Creative,San Diego State University,Advertising,4 months,Should I disclose to my boss that I have ocd? It doesn’t seem to impact my job other than the fact that it’s a huge hit on my confidence and I have anxiety over speaking up from time to time.

He seems to have Tourette’s or something. I have OCD and get driven crazy by repeated noises. After months of this, it has gotten to the point where I can’t focus and am constantly on edge.

OCD,a Manager,San Diego State University,Consulting,a month,It vexes me how OCD is used as a cutesy adjective. It can be a debilitating disability. Here I am at almost 2am with chemical burns all across my arms and hands and nails bleeding and peeled past the quick because of my OCD. I'm so tired of this. I hate this so much. It isn't a cute adjective or a funky quirk. When someone tells you please don't touch my stuff or me listen to them. I thought once I was an adult out of school into work people would be mature about this but they're not.,9,8,2,9/20/24 12:04,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/it-vexes-me-how-ocd-is-used-as-a-cutesy-adjective-it-can-be-a-debilitating-disability-here-i-am-at-almost-2am-with-chemical,7

The problem is, my boss is an “old dog”, is OCD and is on me all the time about how things aren’t perfectly the way he wants them to be.

OCD,an Attorney,San Diego State University,Big Law,6 months,"Any suggestions on how to deal with a partner gaslighting you? She is OCD and micromanaging. She frequently comments that she wants concepts phrased a certain way in a document—let’s say phrase “X”. Then, after another review, she’ll say “Why the hell did you write X? It should be Y!” I’ve tried documenting by email, but she knows she contradicts herself and avoids email. I’m really trying to work with other partners more, but she keeps piling work on me.

When I’m very anxious about something, I develop some routines and become hyper focused on my anxiety. For instance, I have flight anxiety, and I obsessively check turbulence ahead of time days in advance, I don’t fly into certain airports, I only sit on window seats over the wings, etc. I would cancel a flight or pay extra to follow “the protocol.” I’ve done it for a few other things as well.

I overthink a lot, I get lot of tension.
I have very low patience, due to which I make some bad decisions in life.
I confirm even small things with others before doing anything.
Have developed OCD.
I am very innocent (maybe dumb), I don't know how to fight back, even if I know the other person is fooling me, still I don't resist, it caused me money loss too.
My mind will kill me one day. I was not this personality before.
