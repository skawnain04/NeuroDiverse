Autism,a Vice President,San Diego State University,Parents at Work,2 months,"Very close to pull the trigger to take 2-3 years off to be a SAHM. Wanted to see the thoughts.
Reasons:
1: have 2 kids (7 and 4). The younger one has modest autism. It has been very challenging to get him to sit and eat on the table and just to be more independent in general so wanted to spend more time there.
2: we have ~3mm net worth now and husband typically makes 500k or more as a limited partner in a small company so financially we are probably ok

Depression,a Data Entry Clerk,San Diego State University,Toxic Boss,2 months,"My boss took over my Office 5 years ago . She usurped my former boss and I am one of the few left in the office from the former regime. She has made my life Hell . Took me out of the job I was doing for 7 years and installed me to doing jobs I don't know . I wouldn't have a problem with change if I received actual training . Her and her Cronies harrass me daily. I am not happy at all . I would quit but I will lose my pension and insurance. She enjoys my depression ,",,0.0,,9/21/24 13:30,https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/my-boss-took-over-my-office-5-years-ago-she-usurped-my-former-boss-and-i-am-one-of-the-few-left-in-the-office-from-the-former-regime,566.0,No hashtags found,Unknown,No.,Toxic work environment.,Yes.,No.,No.,No.,No.,No.,No.
